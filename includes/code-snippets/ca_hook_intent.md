```js
ca.setOnIntentHook(({ intent, allow, deny, refresh }) => {
    // This is a hook for the dev to show user the intent, the sources and associated fees

    // intent: Intent data containing sources and fees for display purpose
    // allow(): accept the current intent
    // deny(): deny the intent and stop the flow
    // refresh(): should be on a timer of 5s to refresh the intent (if not refreshed old intents might fail due to fee changes)
  })
```
