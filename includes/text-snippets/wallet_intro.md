Web3 application developers can easily provide instant, non-custodial wallets to their users by integrating with the Arcana Auth SDK. This removes the need for users to install a separate wallet, back up their keys, or navigate the process of buying cryptocurrency. Instead, users can sign blockchain transactions directly within the application using the embedded web wallet widget, without the need for any browser extensions.

The Arcana wallet offers a user-friendly, secure, and customizable interface that can be branded to match your application. Users do not need to generate or manage their cryptographic keys or remember any passphrases. The wallet is built using the state-of-the-art asynchronous, distributed key generation protocol which allows users to have full control over their wallets and abstracts the complexity of cryptography. With Arcana wallet, Web3 application users can experience true self-sovereign decentralized identity.
