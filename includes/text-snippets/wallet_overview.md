**Supported Web3 Wallet Operations**

* Check account balance
* Sign blockchain transactions
* Add, and modify the network configuration
* Switch to a different network
* Deploy smart contract to a specific network
* Add, send, and receive custom tokens (ERC-20) and NFTs (ERC-721 and ERC-1155)
* View account transaction activity such as how many native, custom tokens or NFTs were transacted or contracts deployed 
* Use the provider interface to call any [standard Ethereum JSON RPC specification](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/) methods
* Export private key and use it to import {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} account to a third-party Web3 provider

!!! note

    In the future, the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} may also allow application users to permit application developers and see their profile data such as email ID, profile picture, and user name.

!!! caution "**Not Supported**"

    The {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} does not allow an app user to import any blockchain account created using a third-party wallet provider. 

**Wallet Usage Configuration**

{{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} can be configured at the time of integrating the application with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. While instantiating a new `AuthProvider`, the developer can choose one of the available wallet user experiences for signing blockchain transactions through the `alwaysVisible` input parameter. See [{{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} visibility mode]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/anwallet/walletuimodes.md) and the [{{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} configuration guide]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/arcana_wallet/config_walletvisibility.md) for details.

**Adding Networks**

The {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} comes pre-configured with some of the popular blockchain networks such as Ethereum and Polygon. Other [[state-of-the-arcana-auth#supported-blockchains|supported blockchain network configurations]] can be added programmatically to the wallet by application developers. 
        
These additional network settings are stored and retained across user login sessions. If the developer has configured the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} visibility mode to `alwaysVisible=true`, then the wallet is always visible in the applications' context. Users can use the wallet UI to add new network configurations and switch to a different network than the one that the developer has provided by default. This is not possible if the `alwaysVisible=false` setting is used during the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} integration. In this case, the wallet shows up only when a user has to approve a blockchain transaction and disappears after a user action. For more details, see [{{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} visibility modes]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/anwallet/walletuimodes.md) and [network switching behavior]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/anwallet/walletntwkswitchmode.md).
