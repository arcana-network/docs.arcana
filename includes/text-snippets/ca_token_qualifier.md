!!! Tip "Supported Tokens"

    * USDC and USDT tokens are supported if available on the chain. We support Circle-issued tokens if Circle is present on chain, canonical otherwise.
    * ETH is supported as an ERC-20 token if it's managed or issued by the operator or leader of the chain.
    * The native token for a chain is always supported.
