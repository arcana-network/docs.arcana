After adding code to onboard users, you can optionally use the standard JSON RPC Web3 wallet operations supported by the `AuthProvider`. See [[index-web3-wallet-ops|how to enable Web3 operations using the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}]] for details. 

Manage the user experience for signing blockchain transactions by selecting the default, built-in {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI and tinkering with the [[configure-wallet-visibility|wallet visibility]] or [[custom-wallet-ui|replacing the built-in wallet with a custom wallet UI]].

To learn how to deploy the app on Testnet/Mainnet, see [[deploy-app|App Deployment Guide]].
