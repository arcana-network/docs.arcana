!!! an-caution "Non-EVM Chains"

      When registering an app through {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}, the choice of chain type (EVM, MultiversX, or Solana) is final. App developers can't change it later.  They can switch the default chain within the same type. For example, a Solana app on Testnet can switch to Solana Mainnet or Solana Dev but not to MultiversX or an EVM chain.
