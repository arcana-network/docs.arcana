Unified balance shows all the liquidity in a user's EoA account across multiple chains in one view. It lets users transact seamlessly on any chain without needing bridges or pre-provisioning gas for token swaps.

For instance, if a user has 0 USDC , 4 ETH on Optimism, 10 USDC on Arbitrum, and 15 USDC on Base then sending 16 USDC on Optimism would typically require swapping or bridging across chains in multiple steps. With unified balance, the user simply states the intent to send 16 USDC on Optimism, and the chain abstraction handles it in one go with a single approval.
