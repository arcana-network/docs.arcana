??? Example "Transak"

      Transak requires each user to complete KYC by submitting country-specific identification documents. Once the verification is complete, the user can purchase the cryptocurrency with Transak.  This verification is a one-time thing and subsequent purchases will not require this additional step. The figure below shows an example of a purchase transaction using Transak.
