!!! an-danger "Disabling Gasless Capability"

      Once a gas tank is set up, gasless transactions feature will remain active in {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} for that blockchain. The EoA and SCW addresses will always be available, even if the gas tank is paused or empty. Users can switch between these addresses in the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI.
