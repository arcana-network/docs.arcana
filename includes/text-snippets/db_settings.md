=== "Social Auth"

    !!! Example
    
          For example, if you wish to enable Google and Discord login options for your application, make sure you provide the requisite inputs required for these providers in the settings below.  You can leave other provider entries as blank.

          By default, password-free login is always enabled in the Auth SDK.

    **Social Auth Settings:**

    * **Redirect URI:** URL auto-generated by Arcana to complete OAuth verification. It needs to be added in the redirect URI for all the social authentication providers that are configured for the dApp.
    * **Social Auth:** Select dApp user onboarding experience and provide [social authentication provider specific configuration details]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/config_social_providers.md). <br></br><img alt="Social OAuth" src="/img/an_db_configure_social.png" width="85%"></img>

    **Arcana Wallet Settings:**
