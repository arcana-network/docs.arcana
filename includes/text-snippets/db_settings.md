=== "General"

    **Settings:**

    * Application name, wallet branding/logo customization
    * Control to delete the dApp record from the Arcana blockchain

=== "Auth SDK"

    **Settings:**

    * **Social Auth:** Select dApp user onboarding experience and provide [social authentication provider specific configuration details]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/config_social_providers.md). <img alt="Social OAuth" src="/img/an_db_social_auth.png"></img>
    * **Wallet:** Website Domain - Set our website domain here. It is used for security reasons by the server, to restrict Arcana wallet from loading anywhere else other than the domain you specify. Arcana uses frame-ancestor CSP for restricted domains.
