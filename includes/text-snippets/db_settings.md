**Click** on the tabs below to learn more about various configuration settings for branding, social authentication and Arcana wallet.

=== "Branding"

    Use branding settings to manage the look and feel of the Arcana wallet that shows up in an application context. By default, Arcana wallet displays <img src="/img/an_wallet_default_branding_logo.png" alt="default branding logo" width="3%" /> logo and uses the dark theme.

    **Branding Settings:**

    * **Upload Logo:** Upload light and dark theme branding/logo images and customize the wallet UI that shows up in the context of your application for any authenticated user. You can customize the logo mark that shows in a minimized wallet. You can also customize the horizontal logo that shows up in the top left of the Arcana wallet UI right before the registered application name. 
    * **Wallet Theme:** Choose an appropriate wallet theme for your application. Dark theme is the default.<br></br><img alt="Branding" src="/img/an_db_configure_branding.png" width="85%"></img>

=== "Social Auth"

    Use the social authentication section to manage user onboarding experience by setting up requisite social login providers. Only the providers that are configured for an application will be enabled in the Auth SDK as options for users to onboard the application.

    !!! Example
    
          For example, if you wish to enable Google and Discord login options for your application, make sure you provide the requisite inputs required for these providers in the settings below.  You can leave other provider entries as blank.

          By default, password-free login is always enabled in the Auth SDK.

    **Social Auth Settings:**

    * **Redirect URI:** URL auto-generated by Arcana to complete OAuth verification. It needs to be added in the redirect URI for all the social authentication providers that are configured for the dApp.
    * **Social Auth:** Select dApp user onboarding experience and provide [social authentication provider specific configuration details]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/config_social_providers.md). <br></br><img alt="Social OAuth" src="/img/an_db_configure_social.png" width="85%"></img>

=== "Arcana Wallet"

    Use the Arcana wallet section to specify Arcana wallet additional security settings. (Optional)

    **Arcana Wallet Settings:**

    * **Wallet:** Website Domain - Set our website domain here. It is used for security reasons by the server, to restrict Arcana wallet from loading anywhere else other than the domain you specify. Arcana uses frame-ancestor CSP for restricted domains.<br></br><img alt="Social OAuth" src="/img/an_db_configure_wallet.png" width="85%"></img>
