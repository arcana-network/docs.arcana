To register and configure your app, create a new entry for your app by logging into the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}:

{% include "./text-snippets/db_portal_url.md" %}

Save the unique **{{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}** assigned to the app after registration. It will be required when you integrate the app with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. Also, configure the {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} product usage by specifying branding, setting up [[concept-index-auth-type|authentication providers]], managing blockchains displayed in the wallet, and other settings as required.

See [[configure-auth|how to register and configure app]] using the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} for details.

After registering and configuring the app, install the requisite {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} SDKs as per the [[sdk-installation|app-type and use case]].
