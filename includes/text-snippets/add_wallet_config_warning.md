!!! caution "Custom Network Added by Users"
        
        Only the list of networks configured by the developer programmatically or via the dashboard settings is persisted across the user login sessions. Any additional blockchain network configuration changes introduced by the application users via the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI are only stored locally. Users must re-configure those custom network configurations each time they log in.
