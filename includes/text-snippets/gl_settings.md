The built-in gasless feature of the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} can be used to enable gasless transactions for app users through the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}. For enabling gasless transactions in third-party browser-based wallets supported by the app, developers must use the standalone {{config.extra.arcana.gasless_sdk_name}}.

When enabling [[concept-gasless-transactions|gasless transactions]] in the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}, or a third-party wallet, developers must use the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} and set up gas tanks, whitelist gasless app operations for the supported blockchain networks.

In this guide, you will learn how to configure gasless transactions irrespective of whether you wish to use only the standalone {{config.extra.arcana.gasless_sdk_name}} or use the built-in gasless feature in the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}.

## Steps

Login to the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} and follow these three steps:

### 1. Provision Gas Tanks

Visit the 'Manage Apps' page of the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}. Choose the registered app for which you need to enable the gasless feature. If the app is not registered, create a new app entry by [[register-app-auth|registering it]] and then configure gasless settings to enable gasless transactions.

Click *Configure* dropdown, and choose **Gasless** in the LHS navigation. A registered app has no gas tanks set up by default.  Select **Gas Tanks** to add or edit the gas tanks.

</figure>

Choose the **Add Gas Tank** control; provide a name for the gas tank and select a chain that will be serviced by this gas tank. Refer to the list of [[concept-gasless-transactions#supported-chains|supported chains]] that allow setting up the gas tanks.

Note that you can only set up one gas tank per blockchain network. Once configured, the newly added gas tank is displayed the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}.

### 2. Deposit/Withdraw Credits

To add crypto assets to a new gas tank, the developer needs to use a browser-based wallet like MetaMask and choose an account with sufficient funds. This account is referred to as the [[concept-gasless-transactions#gas-tank-owner|owner's account]]. Anyone, including the developer or third-party sponsors, can contribute credits to the gas tank. However, credits can only be withdrawn into the owner's account.

!!! an-info "Browser-based wallet"

       You can use MetaMask or any other browser-based wallet to deposit credits in a gas tank. Make sure the browser-based wallet sets the `windows.ethereum` variable.

!!! an-caution "Minimum Gas Tank Balance"

       Ensure there is at least 0.1 ETH or native gas token balance in the gas tank for a successful ERC-20 token transaction.

Go to the dashboard page listing all the configured gas tanks. Click 'ellipsis' in the gas tank entry and choose **Deposit** from the dropdown menu list:

* Deposit
* Withdraw
* Manage Whitelist

  <figcaption>Deposit Funds</figcaption>
</figure>

Add the amount you want to deposit, and confirm the transaction. Once it's done, you'll see your **Total Deposit** go up by that amount in the gas tank.

  <img src="{{config.extra.arcana.img_dir}}/an_gl_db_deposit.gif" alt="Gas Tank deposit update" class="an-screenshots"/>

To withdraw funds, click 'ellipsis' and choose **Withdraw** from the menu list. Enter the amount you wish to withdraw. After successful withdrawal, the **Total Amount** in the gas tank goes down by the withdrawal amount and the owner's wallet address will see the withdrawn amount added.

To take out money, click the 'ellipsis' and pick *Withdraw* from the menu. Enter the amount you want to withdraw. When it's done, the gas tank's Total Amount drops by what you withdrew, and the owner's wallet gets the money.

### 3. Whitelist Operations

To whitelist one or more app functions, choose **Manage Whitelist** and specify the following:

* Contract Address
* Contract ABI

On the right-hand side, you'll find a list of functions. Use the radio buttons to select the ones that are eligible for gasless transactions. Only these functions will enable gasless operations when users perform blockchain transactions related to them.

  <figcaption>Whitelist Operations</figcaption>
</figure>

### Optional: Enable/Disable Smart Accounts

Developers can choose to enable/disable smart accounts. When the smart accounts are disabled, all transactions happen via the EoA account. What this means is that the gas tank is paused when smart accounts are disabled. 

When smart accounts are disabled, users pay gas fees for whitelisted app operations. They can access both EoA as well as the smart account.

</figure>

That is all! ðŸŽ‰

You have successfully configured gasless operation for the application users.  

## What's next?

After configuring gasless, integrate the app with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. Add code to onboard users and allow authenticated users to sign blockchain transactions.
