!!! an-caution "Passkeys: Alternate Login vs. Sign-up"

      Apps that use {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} passkey auth let users log in with a passkey, but only after they've first signed up or logged in using another option. Then, they can create and link passkeys to their account.

      Once the passkey is set up, users can use it for future logins
