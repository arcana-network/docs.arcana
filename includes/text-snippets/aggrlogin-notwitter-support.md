!!! info "No Aggregate Login with Twitter OAuth "

      The [[concept-aggregate-login|aggregate login feature]] does not work for the Steam OAuth login mechanism.

      When a user has the same email registered with a social OAuth provider and Steam OAuth, logging in with Steam makes a new unique account. Even if the user later logs in with the same email through a social OAuth provider or passwordless, it creates a different wallet address for the same user.
