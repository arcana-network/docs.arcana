One of the limitations of using the [`{{config.extra.arcana.wagmi_sdk_pkg_name}}`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcana/auth-wagmi) package is that the  `ArcanaConnector` is a wrapper around the `AuthProvider` and does not expose the ability to build custom UI for onboarding users. It provides [user onboarding only via the plug-and-play]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/onboard_users/wallet_plugnplay.md) feature of the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} that brings up a built-in pop-up UI.
