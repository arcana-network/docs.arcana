??? an-warning "Wallet Chain Edit Persistence"
      
      The list of networks configured by the developer, either programmatically or via the dashboard, persists across user login sessions. 
      
      User changes to blockchain networks through the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI are stored locally and lost when the user logs out.
