        The list of networks set by the developer is saved across user login sessions. This can be done programmatically or through dashboard settings. Any changes to blockchain networks made by users in the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI are only stored locally. Users must reconfigure these custom networks every time they log in.
