        Apps using {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} can let users log in with passkeys, but not sign up with them.

        Apps must offer sign-up or login through traditional methods (social login, passwordless, etc.). After logging in, users can set up a passkey for future logins. Once thatâ€™s done, they can choose the "login via passkeys" option next time they log in.
