In Arcana's Chain Abstraction solution, allowance means pre-authorizing funds from a user's EoA to enable a transaction that spans multiple chains in Web3 apps.

To enable unified balance across chains with Chain Abstraction, the user must possess funds on the source chain(s) and set up an allowance. This allowance lets the Arcana Vault contract(s) on the source chain(s) access the required funds. By granting permission, the user authorizes Arcana to process transactions and spend funds as needed on the source chain(s) for seamless transactions across chains.
