Chain abstraction and unified balances offer the following benefits to Web3 app users and developers:

* **Lower Complexity:** Users specify their desired outcome and maximum price. Behind the scenes, solvers handle swaps, conversions, and routing securely and transparently.
* **Unified Liquidity:** Users see a consolidated view of their assets across all chains without needing manual bridges or swaps.
* **Simplified UX:** It eliminates the technical and time-consuming multi-step hurdles, creating a seamless experience for both experts and casual users by eliminating the clutter between user expectation and reality of blockchain ecosystem.
* **Streamlined DX:** Developers can enable unified balances in dApps without altering existing stacks. With the Arcana Chain Abstraction SDK, they can integrate seamlesslyâ€”no need to write smart contracts or manage chain switching for transactions on new chains.
