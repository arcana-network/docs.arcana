Allowances activate Arcana Network's Chain Abstraction feature. 
They unlock your fragmented liquidity across multiple chains, 
letting you spend on any destination chainâ€”even with insufficient balance there.

By approving allowances for chain abstraction using source chains, users can:

* Spend anywhere with funds from multiple chains.
* Bypass bridging to enable liquidity on the destination chain.
* Transact seamlessly across chains.
* Setup once, use repeatedly.

Allowances must be set up anytime **before** initiating a multi-chain transaction.
