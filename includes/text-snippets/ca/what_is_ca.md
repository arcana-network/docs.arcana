In the blockchain ecosystem, managing multiple chains, tokens, and accounts fragments user liquidity. Even with sufficient balances across chains, users face challenges executing transactions due to scattered assets. To transact, they must first convert assets into those acceptable on the target chain. This often involves complex, multi-step conversions to find the best route, a task not every user has the expertise or time for.

## Streamline & Simplify

Chain abstraction streamlines the process by:

* **Hiding Complexity:** Users specify their desired outcome and maximum price. Behind the scenes, solvers handle swaps, conversions, and routing securely and transparently.
* **Unified Liquidity:** Users see a consolidated view of their assets across all chains without needing manual bridges or swaps.
* **Better UX:** It eliminates the technical and time-consuming multi-step hurdles, creating a seamless experience for both experts and casual users by eliminating the clutter between user expectation and reality of blockchain ecosystem.

With chain abstraction, users gain a simplified, cohesive view of their wallet and liquidity, empowering them to focus on **specifying clear intent** rather than the how part of transaction execution to realize the intent.
