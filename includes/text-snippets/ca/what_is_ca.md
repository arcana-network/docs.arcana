For Web3 app users, managing multiple chains, tokens, and accounts often leads to liquidity fragmentation in their wallets. Even with sufficient overall token asset balance, users struggle to transact because funds are scattered across several chains. To transact, users must convert assets from two or more source chains into those accepted on the target chain. This is a complex, time-consuming process not everyone can navigate.

Chain Abstraction lets users view and access a [[concept-unified-balance|unified balance]] across chains associated with their wallet account, enabling them to transact on any chain. It shifts the focus from having to bootstrap funds to transact on the destination chain to **specifying a clear intent** for the transaction. This simplifies the transaction process and makes it accessible to a wider audience.
