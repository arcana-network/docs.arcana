# Build Passwordless Auth
.
In this guide, you will learn how {{page.meta.arcana.app_type}} app can use the {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} product to easily onboard users through the passwordless login option in a custom login UI.

## Prerequisites

* Make sure you can access the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}: {% include "./text-snippets/db_portal_url.md" %}
* The app must be [[register-app-auth|registered using the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}]] and a unique {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} must be already assigned to it. This {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} is essential for integrating the app with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}
* Follow the instructions to [[integrate-react-nextjs-app|integrate the React app]] with the {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} product.

!!! an-info "Configuring App"

      Unlike other user onboarding options that require enabling authentication providers, passwordless login does **not** require any configuration setup through the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}.

## Steps

*Enabling passwordless login in a React app is simple!*

After integrating the app, add the code to onboard users in a passwordless manner using the SDK method listed below. 

!!! an-tip "`useAuth() hook`"

     Use `loginWithLink` (deprecated) `loginWithOTPStart` and `loginWithOTPComplete` through the `useAuth` hook offered by the {{config.extra.arcana.react_sdk_name}} and trigger passwordless login to onboard the users. 

App users must supply an email ID to receive the OTP for logging into the app. An OTP is sent to the specified email ID. When the user provides the same OTP in the app context, authentication is complete and a wallet address is assigned to the user.

### Login with link

{% include "./code-snippets/auth_pwdless.md" %}

### Login with OTP

{% include "./code-snippets/auth_pwdless_otp.md" %}

{% include "./text-snippets/warn_otp_global_app_keys.md" %}

{% include "./text-snippets/warn_otp_mfa_enabled.md" %}

**That is all!**  :material-party-popper:

Your React app is all set for onboarding users via the passwordless login option.

## What's Next?

Authenticated users can instantly access the in-app {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI for signing blockchain transactions. Use the `AuthProvider` EIP-1193 standard Ethereum provider to call JSON/RPC functions and Web3 wallet operations in the app. [[evm-web3-wallet-ops|Learn more...]]
