After logging in, the *Manage Apps* dashboard screen is displayed. 

**List Registered Apps**

Each app registered for a developer account is represented by a card in the *Manage Apps* screen of the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}.

**Initiate App Registration**

In the 'Manage Apps' dashboard, click *Create New App* wizard to register a new app. <img class="an-screenshots" src="/img/dashboard_newappwizard.png" alt="Wizard: Register App" width="10%"/> 

**Registration Settings**

To register a new app, the developer needs to provide the following settings: 

* App name
* Chain Type: EVM, Solana, MultiversX
* Default Blockchain
* Wallet UI Mode

**App Name**

Add a unique name for the app. It can be edited later. After registration, a unique {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} is associated with each app name. This {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} is never changed, even if the app name is altered.

All emails related to a registered app billing or user login will mention the latest app name as displayed in the dashboard. Once an app is deleted, the {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} is no longer valid. Creating a new app with the same name and registering it with {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} will result in a new {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} associated with the same name.

!!! an-tip "Edit App Name"

      To edit the name of a registered app entry, use the pen icon. Click ++enter++ in the editable text field to save the changes.

**Chain Type**

Developers need to decide at the time of registration whether the app will use the EVM chains or one of the non-EVM chains supported by the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}.

{% include "./text-snippets/non-evm-warning.md" %}

**Default Blockchain**

The chain marked as default is the one that is selected and displayed in the wallet once the user logs into an app that is integrated with the {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}}.

The default chain can be changed programmatically via the app developer once the user approves switching of the chain. Also, the user can change the default chain anytime by using the wallet UI. Chains can be switched to any one of the ones displayed in the pre-configured list in the wallet UI or in the app chain settings displayed in the dashboard.

**Wallet UI Mode**

The [[concept-wallet-uimodes|wallet UI mode]] setting allows the developers to choose whether they want to enable the built-in {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI in the context of their app or build a custom wallet UI for the app users. Note, this is a **one-time** setting at the time of registering the app.

By default, {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI is enabled for all registered apps. Selecting **Custom Wallet UI** option disables the built-in {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI altogether.

!!! an-danger "Custom Wallet UI"

      This is a **one-time setting**. It cannot be changed again later once the app is registered. When selecting the custom wallet UI option, developers must build a custom wallet UI and programmatically wire it to the appropriate JSON-RPC Web3 wallet operations. Also, there are no notifications generated by the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} when a custom wallet UI is selected. The developers must add requisite logic and code to get the user approvals for blockchain operations.

**Confirm Registration**

After providing all the required inputs, click **Create** to register the app.

![Register dApp](/img/an_db_create_newapp_anim.gif){.an-screenshots}

A newly registered app dashboard displays Testnet configuration settings. A unique {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} is assigned for the Testnet profile. Developer can deploy the app on the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} once SDK usage is configured in the dashboard and app is integrated with the SDK.

!!! an-tip "Mainnet Deployment" 

      To deploy the app on the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet, developers need to create a Mainnet configuration profile and obtain a different {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}. Update the integration code with this Mainnet {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}. This step is necessary to deploy the app on the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet.

Click **Configure** in the  LHS menu to view and edit the configuration settings.
