After logging in, the *Manage Apps* dashboard screen is displayed. 

**List Registered Apps**

Each app registered for a developer account is represented by a card in the *Manage Apps* screen of the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}.

**Initiate App Registration**

In the 'Manage Apps' dashboard, click *Create New App* wizard to register a new app. <img class="an-screenshots-noeffects" src="/img/icons/dashboard_newappwizard.png" alt="create new app wizard icon" width="10%"/> 

**Registration Settings**

To register a new app, the developer needs to provide the following settings. 

* App name
* Default Blockchain
* Wallet UI Mode

**App Name**

Add a unique name for the app. It can be edited later. After registration, a unique {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} is associated with each app name. This {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} is never changed, even if the app name is altered.

All emails related to a registered app billing or user login will mention the latest app name as displayed in the dashboard. Once an app is deleted, the {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} is no longer valid. Creating a new app with the same name and registering it with {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} will result in a new {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} associated with the same name.

!!! tip "Edit App Name"

      To edit the name of a registered app entry, use the pen icon. Click ++enter++ in the editable text field to save the changes.

**Default Blockchain**

The default blockchain refers to the chain selection displayed in the wallet once the user logs into an app that is integrated with the {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}}. The default chain can be changed programmatically via the app developer once the user approves switching of the chain. Also, the user can change the default chain anytime by using the wallet UI.

**Wallet UI Mode**

The wallet UI mode setting allows the developers to choose whether they want to enable the built-in {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI in the context of their app or build a custom wallet UI for the app users. Note, this is a **one-time** setting at the time of registering the app.

By default, {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI is enabled for all registered apps. Selecting **Custom Wallet UI** option disables the built-in {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI altogether.

!!! danger "Custom Wallet UI"

      This is a **one-time setting**. It cannot be changed again later once the app is registered. When selecting the custom wallet UI option, developers must build a custom wallet UI and programmatically wire it to the appropriate JSON-RPC Web3 wallet operations. Also, there are no notifications generated by the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} when a custom wallet UI is selected. The developers must add requisite logic and code to get the user approvals for blockchain operations.

**Confirm Registration**

After providing all the required inputs, click **Create** to register the app.

![Register dApp](/img/an_db_create_newapp_anim.gif){.an-screenshots}

After registration, the app dashboard displays the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet usage statistics for the newly registered app. By default, the app is registered for Testnet usage and a unique {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} assigned corresponding to the Testnet configuration profile. With this Testnet {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}, the app can **only** be deployed on the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet.

Click **Configure** in the  LHS menu to view and edit {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} usage configuration settings.

!!! tip "Mainnet Deployment"

      To deploy the app on Arcana Mainnet, the developers must create the Mainnet configuration profile, and obtain the {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} associated with the Mainnet profile. Use this new {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} to integrate the app with the {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}}. Only then the app can be deployed on the Arcana Mainnet.
