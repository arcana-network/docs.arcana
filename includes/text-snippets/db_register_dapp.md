All the apps registered against the developer's account show up as cards in the *Manage Apps* screen of the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}.

Click on the *Create New App* wizard, the first card on the *Manage Apps* screen, to register a new app. <img class="an-screenshots-noeffects" src="/img/icons/dashboard_newappwizard.png" alt="create new app wizard icon" width="10%"/> 

Click the wizard and specify the name of the app to be registered in the **App Name** field. Also, select a default chain for the app. This is the chain that is selected as the default chain in the wallet UI once a user logs into the application. 

Choose the **Wallet UI Mode** for the app. By default, {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI is enabled for all registered apps. Selecting **Custom Wallet UI** option disables the built-in {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI altogether.

!!! warning "Custom Wallet UI"

      This is a **one-time setting**. Once enabled it cannot be changed again after the app is registered. When selecting the custom wallet UI option, developers must build a custom wallet UI and programmatically wire it to the appropriate JSON-RPC Web3 wallet operations. Also, there are no notifications generated by the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} in this case and developers need to add requisite logic and code to get the user approvals for blockchain operations.

When you click **Create**, the app is registered for using the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet by default.

!!! tip

      To edit the name of a registered app entry, use the pen icon. Click ++enter++ in the editable text field to save the changes.

After successfully registering an app, the app dashboard screen is displayed automatically. It shows the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet usage statistics for the app. By default, every newly registered app is associated with the 'Testnet' configuration profile. Use **Configure** in the  LHS menu to view and edit configuration settings.
