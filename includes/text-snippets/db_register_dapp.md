Use the 'Create New App' wizard and provide the following inputs to create your app entry:

Click **Create** to create a new application entry and register it with the Arcana network.

      Once an application entry is created, you cannot edit the application name. To do that, you will need to delete the application entry on the dashboard and create a new one.

After a successful registration, you will see the application dashboard screen:

The application dashboard screen displays usage statistics and application configuration settings. Use these settings to manage user onboarding options and Arcana wallet user experience.
