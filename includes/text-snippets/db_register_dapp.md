**View Registered Apps**

All the apps registered against the developer's account show up as cards in the *Manage Apps* screen of the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}.

**Initiate App Registration**

In the 'Manage Apps' dashboard, click *Create New App* wizard to register a new app. <img class="an-screenshots-noeffects" src="/img/icons/dashboard_newappwizard.png" alt="create new app wizard icon" width="10%"/> 

**Registration Settings**

To register a new app, the developer needs to provide the following settings. 

* App name
* Default Blockchain
* Wallet UI Mode

**App Name**

The developer can edit and change the displayed app name. After registration, a unique {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} is associated with each app name. However, the {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} assigned to an app is never changed, even if its name is altered.

All emails related to app billing or user login will mention the latest app name as displayed in the dashboard. Once an app is deleted, the {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} is no longer valid. Creating a new app with the same name and registering it with {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} will result in a new {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} associated with the same name.

!!! tip

      To edit the name of a registered app entry, use the pen icon. Click ++enter++ in the editable text field to save the changes.

**Default Blockchain**

After the app is registered, configured and integrated with the {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}}, it is deployed on the Arcana Testnet or Mainnet. When the user logs in, an authenticated user can access Web3 wallet operations and sign blockchain transactions. The default blockchain refers to the chain displayed in the wallet. This chain is used to perform blockchain transactions. It can be changed programmatically by the app developer after seeking user's approval. The user can also change the default chain by using the wallet UI.

**Wallet UI Mode**

The wallet UI mode setting allows the developers to choose whether they want to enable the built-in {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI in the context of their app or build their own wallet UI. Note, this is a **one-time** setting at the time of registering the app.

By default, {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI is enabled for all registered apps. Selecting **Custom Wallet UI** option disables the built-in {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI altogether.

!!! danger "Custom Wallet UI"

      This is a **one-time setting**. Once enabled it cannot be changed again after the app is registered. When selecting the custom wallet UI option, developers must build a custom wallet UI and programmatically wire it to the appropriate JSON-RPC Web3 wallet operations. Also, there are no notifications generated by the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} in this case and developers need to add requisite logic and code to get the user approvals for blockchain operations.

**Confirm Registration**

After providing the inputs listed above, the developer can click **Create** to register the app.

After successfully registering an app, the app dashboard screen is displayed automatically. It shows the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet usage statistics for the app. By default, the app is registered and a unique {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} assigned to it only for Arcana Testnet usage. After integration with the {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}}, the app can **only** be deployed on the Testnet.

After registering the app, developers can click **Configure** in the  LHS menu to view and edit {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} usage configuration settings.

!!! tip "Mainnet Deployment"

      To deploy the app on Arcana Mainnet, the developers must create the Mainnet configuration profile, and obtain the {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} associated with the Mainnet profile, use it to integrate the app with the {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}}. Only then the app can be deployed on the Arcana Mainnet. For details, see [[migrate-app-testnet-mainnet|Testnet > Mainnet Migration Guide]]
