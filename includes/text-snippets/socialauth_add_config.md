!!! tip "Register & Configure"

      Each app is assigned a unique **{{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}** upon registration. A default Testnet configuration is linked with the registered app. No social authentication providers are enabled for the app. Passwordless login is enabled for all registered apps automatically.

      A registered app can be deployed only at the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet. Developers must create a Mainnet profile to deploy a registered app on the Mainnet. Each profile can use identical or different **Social Auth** settings.
