This new release includes support for Custom Auth and wallet UI features for off-ramping crypto to fiat.

## How to Migrate to v1.0.12?

Install and upgrade to the latest {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} v1.0.12. No integration code updates are required for the features in the previous release.  

If you plan on using the Passkeys, check out the section about [[concept-auth-passkeys|Passkeys]] and [[onboard-passkey-auth|how to onboard users via passkeys]] in apps integrated with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. See how to set up user onboarding via [[index-config-social-providers|Telegram, Apple]] in the setup section of the documentation. Then refer to the usage section for [[sdk-installation|how to install the SDK, integrate app and onboard users]] depending upon the app type.

That's all!
