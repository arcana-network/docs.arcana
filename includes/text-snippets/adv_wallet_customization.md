??? an-note "Wallet Customization"

      Manage the user experience for signing blockchain transactions by configuring SDK usage. Specify the[[dashboard-user-guide#settings-overview|theme, branding]] settings of the in-app built-in {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI. Use [[concept-wallet-visibility|wallet visibility]] and decide when to display the wallet UI in the app. Configure [[concept-keyspace-type|keyspace]] and enable the user experience of having the same wallet address across multiple apps integrated with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}.
      
      You can also replace the built-in wallet UI with a [[custom-wallet-ui| custom wallet UI]].
