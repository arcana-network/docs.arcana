To set the storage region for your dApp, log in to the Arcana Developer Dashboard {% include "./text-snippets/db_portal_url.md" %} and choose a region or keep the default setting. This setting cannot be changed later, but other dApp settings such as social authentication provider settings can be reconfigured at any time. To change the storage region, you must [delete the dApp from the dashboard and then configure it again](/{{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/faq/faq_db.md).
