To enable Twitch based social authentication in Web3 applications, developers must perform these three steps before integrating with the Arcana Auth SDK.

## Step 1: Use Arcana Dashboard

Go to the Arcana Dashboard: {% include "./text-snippets/db_portal_url.md" %}

Register your dApp by creating a new dApp entry and specifying a name using the 'Create New App' wizard. 

!!! tip "Registering the Application"
          
      {% include "./text-snippets/socialauth_add_config.md" %}

Use defaults for other settings or change them as per your use case. Refer to the [how to configure dApp guide]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/config_dapp.md) for details.

Go to the `Configure->Social Auth` configuration section and copy the **redirect URI** value displayed there.   This will be used in the next step to generate Twitch OAuth credentials.

Do not close the dashboard browser tab. Open another tab and set up Twitch OAuth. Then come back to the Dashboard tab and complete the dApp configuration settings.

## Step 2: Use Twitch Developer Console

Go to the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/login) and register your dApp as a new Twitch application. ![twitch console](/img/an_dApp_twitch_dev_console.png)

Enter the application name. 

Specify the **Redirect URI** copied from Arcana Dashboard in the previous step into the OAuth Redirect URL field of the Twitch Developer Console.

Copy the **ClientID** that is automatically generated by Twitch for the newly registered application in the Twitch Developer Console. It will be required in the next step while completing the Arcana dashboard dApp configuration.

## Step 3: Update Arcana Dashboard

Revisit the Arcana Developer Dashboard portal. Click on your app entry and visit the application dashboard. Click `Configure->Social Auth` in the LHS navigation bar. Refer to the "Twitch" field and paste the **Client ID** assigned by Twitch Developer Console, in the previous step, in the input text field.

Save the settings. Arcana Network assigns an **App Address** to every registered and configured dApp. You need to save this **App Address** and use it while integrating the dApp with the Auth SDK.
