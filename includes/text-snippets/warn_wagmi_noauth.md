Earlier, to integrate the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} with a Web3 app that uses [`wagmi`](https://wagmi.sh/) or [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) wallet connectors, developers were required to directly install the [`{{config.extra.arcana.wagmi_sdk_pkg_name}}`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcana/auth-wagmi) package and create the `ArcanaConnector`. This has changed for {{config.extra.arcana.wagmi_sdk_pkg_name}} v0.0.5 onward. Developers are now required to **also** install the [`{{config.extra.arcana.auth_sdk_pkg_name}}`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcana/auth) package along with the [`{{config.extra.arcana.wagmi_sdk_pkg_name}}`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcana/auth-wagmi) package.
