# MFA Setup

In this guide users of Web3 apps that integrate with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} will learn how to enable multi-factor authentication, MFA, and secure their blockchain access. 

See [how MFA works]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/mfa.md) for more details.

## Enabling MFA at Login

Log in to an app that is integrated with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} using one of the available authentication providers. At the very first login to such an app, the user will see the following MFA setup prompt:

Click **Proceed** to the next step of the MFA setup. The user must provide answers to five security questions. You can use the security questions already listed there or create new ones by clicking in the question field and saving them.

Make sure you save the responses to the security questions.

## Backup PIN

The last step of MFA setup requires the user to provide a 6-digit alphanumeric PIN that is used to encrypt the backup of one of the MFA constituents and store it in the Arcana ecosystem.

That is all! 
The MFA setup is complete and user's account is enabled for MFA use.

## Enabling MFA Later

If the user chose to not enable MFA at the first login into the app, it can be enabled later. Note that once enabled, MFA cannot be disabled for a user account.

To enable MFA, log into the app that is integrated with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. Access the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} and click on the **User Profile** tab to view the wallet screen. Choose **Setup Now** and then click **Proceed** to set up security questions, answers and specify the required PIN to encrypt the backup share of MFA as described in the previous section.

## MFA Secret Recovery

If the user logs into an app using a different device or a different browser, then the local component of the MFA needs to be regenerated to prove the user's identity. At login, the MFA prompt will guide the user to choose one of the options to recover the encrypted MFA component on the new device or the browser. User can choose one of the options to recover:

* Enter the MFA recovery PIN stored during the MFA setup earlier
* Answer three security questions correctly

Once the user provides one of these options, the local MFA factor is regenerated and the user will not be asked for it again on the same device or the browser app unless local storage is cleared for some reason.
