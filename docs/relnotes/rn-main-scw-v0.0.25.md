## What is New?

---

This release of {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} SDKs offers the brand new {{config.extra.arcana.gasless_sdk_name}}. With this SDK, developers can enable gasless transactions in third-party, browser-based wallets. This is a standalone SDK and does not depend on the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. 

## What has changed?

---

A new SDK has been added to the  {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} offerings.

There are no usage changes, or updates to the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}.

Earlier, Web3 app developers could only use the built-in gasless feature offered in the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} and enable gasless transactions through the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}. The new standalone {{config.extra.arcana.gasless_sdk_name}} now allows third-party browser-based wallets to leverage gasless transactions.

Apps that are already integrated with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} and using the built-in gasless transactions in the  {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} may choose to start using this new gasless standalone SDK for enabling gasless transactions in third-party browser-based wallets such as MetaMask. 

There are no changes for apps that do not use the built-in gasless feature of the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} or do not wish to add gasless transactions to third-party wallets.
