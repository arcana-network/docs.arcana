### Brand new look: {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} 

Check out the newly redesigned {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}. It allows Web3 app developers to register apps with {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} , and configure user onboarding and wallet settings before integrating with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}.

### Application Configuration Profiles

Developers can now choose to deploy applications on the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet or the Mainnet. You can start with the default 'Testnet' app configuration profile and once the application is tested and ready to deploy, deploy it on the Arcana Mainnet.

An under-development application can be deployed on the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet. At the same time, a tested and stable version can be deployed on the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet where the app users can log in and utilize the app.

- Easily register and configure Web3 applications
- Create, delete, and manage application configurations for 'Testnet' and 'Mainnet'
    - Copy settings or create a fresh 'Mainnet' profile
    - While editing, easily toggle between 'Testnet' and 'Mainnet' configuration profiles
    - Each profile can be edited and managed independently
- A new unique **{{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}** is associated with the 'Mainnet' configuration profile

    !!! note
          Do remember to use the correct {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} for integrating with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}when you deploy your application on the Mainnet.

See [[dashboard-user-guide#manage-testnet-and-mainnet-configurations|how to manage application profiles]] for details. 

### App-specific and Global Keys

- App-specific keys are the default, developers can configure it to [[dashboard-user-guide#configure-keyspace|global keyspace type]]
- Developers must submit a verification form and seek approval for enabling global keys 
- Global keys enable a simpler user experience whereby users see the same wallet address across when they log into any app in the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} ecosystem. Users must ensure that they do not sign any malicious transactions of any fraudulent app. To mitigate this risk, {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} requires developers to submit a verification form before the global keys feature is enabled for an app.

### Monitor Application Usage Metrics

- Both Testnet and Mainnet Usage are now tracked for monthly active users (MAU). The application dashboard screen displays usage metrics.
- 'Testnet' configuration profile screen displays Testnet usage
- 'Mainnet' configuration profile screen displays Mainnet usage
- No charges are levied for using {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet. Billing for {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet usage will be calculated at the end of every month.
  
See [[dashboard-user-guide#monitor-usage|{{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} User Guide]] for details.
