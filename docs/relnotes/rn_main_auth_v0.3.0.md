### Brand new look: Arcana Developer Dashboard

Our design team has used their magic wand to spruce up the developer dashboard for better productivity.

  - Easily register and configure Web3 applications
  - Simple to create and delete application configuration
  - View application usage details, settings 
  - Quickly switch from configuring / viewing one application settings to another
  
See [Arcana Developer Dashboard User Guide]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/db/config_dApp_with_db.md) for details.

TBD - Add a fully populated dashboard screenshot that shows multiple apps on the Manage apps screen.

### Easily Manage Application Configuration Profile (Testnet / Mainnet)  

We have made it super easy for developers to migrate their Web3 applications from Testnet to Mainnet. You can start with the default testnet profile and once the application is tested and ready to deploy, simply toggle to Mainnet settings.

  - By default, both testnet and mainnet profiles are identical.
  - Both Testnet and Mainnet configuration setting profiles can be edited and managed independently.
  - For mainnet configuration profile, a new unique App Address is assigned to the app.

Note: Do remember to use the correct App Address when you deploy your application on the Mainnet.

See [manage application profiles]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/db/config_dApp_with_db.md#manage-testnet-and-mainnet-configurations) for details.

TBD - Add a fully populated screenshot with some non zero users logged into an application configuration screen.
