# CA SDK Release Note

**Release Date: 17 Feb 2025**  

Version: **v0.0.5**

## What is New?

---
 
This is a minor update release with the following changes:

1. Earlier, to instantiate a `CA` object, you had to pass in the `provider`. Now, there is no input parameter to the constructor.
2. A new `setEVMProvider` method is added to the `CA` class. This method can be used to set the EVM provider later.


=== "Old"

    ```typescript
    let provider: window.ethereum;
    const ca = new CA(provider);
    ```

=== "New"

    ```typescript
    let provider: window.ethereum;
    const ca = new CA();
    ca.setEVMProvider(provider);
    ```
