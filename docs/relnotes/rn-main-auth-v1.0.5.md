## New Product Features

---

### Auth for Mobile Apps

The {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} product now allows mobile apps built using Flutter and React-Native frameworks to easily onboard users through the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} and sign blockchain transactions. 

Flutter app developers must install the `{{config.extra.arcana.mobile_flutter_sdk_pkg_name}}` package and refer to the [[flutter-quick-start|Arcana Auth Quick Start Guide for Flutter Apps]] to integrate Web3 Flutter apps with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} SDK.

React-Native app developers must install the `{{config.extra.arcana.mobile_react_native_sdk_pkg_name}}` package and refer to the [[react-native-quick-start|Arcana Auth Quick Start Guide for React-Native Apps]] to integrate Web3 React-Native apps with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} SDK.

### White-labeled Auth 

The new white-labeled auth feature allows Web3 app developers to configure the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} and disable the built-in {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI. Developers can replace it with a custom wallet UI and build necessary interfaces to call the Web3 wallet operations themselves along with notification UI for requesting user approval for signing a blockchain transaction. See [[custom-wallet-ui|how to plug in a custom wallet UI]] and use the white-labeled auth feature. 

### Steam OAuth Support

Web3 applications that integrate with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} can now onboard users via [Steam OAuth](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview/oauth). See [[config-auth-steam|how to configure Steam as an onboarding option]] section for more details. After configuring one or more authentication providers through the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}, applications can onboard users with a single line of code using `loginWithSocial` call. Developers can use the built-in plug-and-play login UI feature of the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} or use a custom login UI and allow users to onboard the app using Steam. See [[index-onboard-users|how to onboard users]] section and choose the app type for instructions on how to onboard users with Steam.

### Firebase Auth Support

Besides Cognito custom authentication, the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} now also allows apps to onboard users via Firebase. To enable Firebase, developers must:

* [[config-auth-firebase|Configure Firebase settings]] in the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}
* [[index-integrate|Install and integrate the app]] with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}
* Make sure that the app is also integrated with the Firebase SDKs and that the required Firebase services are configured. 
* Use a custom login UI to initiate Firebase login and listen for user authentication success event from Firebase.
* Pass on the Firebase token to the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} user onboarding function - `loginWithBearer` and allow authenticated users to sign blockchain transactions.

Refer to the [Firebase auth integration example](https://github.com/arcana-network/auth-examples) for details.
