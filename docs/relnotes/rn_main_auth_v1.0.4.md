# Release Notes Arcana Auth (Mainnet)

{==

**Version: v1.0.4**

**Release Date: April 4th, 2023**

==}

## Feature Updates

### Billing & Invoices

Arcana Auth SDK now supports billing and invoice for Arcana Mainnet usage. See [Billing & Invoices]() for details. Also, checkout out the Arcana Dashboard Guide to learn how developers can access and update their account billing information, and check pending invoices and billing history.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Arcana Auth SDK provides more robust user authentication through multi-factor authentication. Web3 app users can choose to enable MFA when logging in. Once enabled, it cannot be turned off. Developers can choose to make MFA optional for their apps or make it mandatory for user sign-in. See [Arcana MFA]() for details on how MFA works in apps that integrate with the Arcana Auth SDK.

For details, see how to enable MFA in web3 apps. App users can refer to the MFA user's guide to learn more about how to set up MFA.
