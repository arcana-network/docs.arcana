## Why it matters?

Not all Web3 users have the knowledge, patience, or resources to track down the best routes for liquidity. With chain abstraction, that complexity disappears. Users get seamless access to liquidity on any chain, boosting accessibility for both new apps and new users.

## Why Integrate?

The rise of L2s has fragmented liquidity across multiple chains, making it hard for users to manage funds. Without chain abstraction, users are forced to bridge assets manually â€” a complex, time-consuming process, especially for newcomers. This makes onboarding millions (or billions) of users to Web3 an uphill battle.

Chain abstraction solves this by offering a unified balance. Users can access and spend funds across multiple chains without manual bridging. This reduces friction, lowers entry barriers, and simplifies the user experience.
