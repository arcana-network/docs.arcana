# Configure Shardeum in the Arcana Wallet

This guide is meant of Arcana wallet users and provides instructions on how to configure Arcana wallet for signing blockchain transactions via the Shardeum Network.

## Step 1:  Log in to the App

If a developer has not integrated the App with the Shardeum Network programmatically, the authenticated app users can use the Arcana wallet UI and add the network manually. The first step is to log in to the app and authenticate user first.

## Step 2: Configure Wallet UI

Bring up the wallet UI screen if it is minimized in the app's context. Refer to instructions in the Arcana Wallet User Guide for [adding a network]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/wallet_ui.md#addselect-a-network). Use the [latest Shardeum Network configuration details](https://docs.shardeum.org/network/endpoints) and provide them in the Arcana wallet.
