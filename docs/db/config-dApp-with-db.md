# {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} Users Guide

The {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} allows Web3 app developers to configure user onboarding settings and tailor the blockchain signing experience for an app that integrates with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}.

Developers must first register the app by using the [{{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/dashboard.md) and obtain a unique **{{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}** that is required to integrate the app with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}.

By default, each newly registered app is associated with a 'Testnet' configuration profile. When the app is deployed, it is set to use the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet.

This guide will walk you through the various configuration options available on the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} to tailor the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} usage.  For instructions on how to install {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} and integrate your application, refer to the [[auth-quick-start|{{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} Quick Start Guide]].

#### Configure Keyspace 

There are two keyspace options: [[concept-keyspace-type|App-specific and Global Keys]].

You can either use the default, highly secure **App-specific** keyspace option or **Global** keyspace depending upon the desired level of security and user experience required for the application. 

![Mainnet Keyspace options](/img/an_db_keyspace_options.png){.an-screenshots}

Select **Global Keyspace** and click **Verify**. This will bring up a verification form. Fill out the verification form, and click **Submit**. 

<img class="an-screenshots-noeffects" alt="Global Keyspace Verify" src="/img/an_db_global_keys_verify.png" width="25%" />

You can check the status of **Global Keyspace** verification by using the **Keyspace** screen. After submitting the form, you will see the status as **In Review**.

![Mainnet Global keyspace in review](/img/an_db_global_keys_inreview.png){.an-screenshots}

The status will change to **Approved** once verification is complete. You can integrate your application with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} but do not deploy it until the verification is complete. Otherwise, users that log in before verification is complete may see different wallet addresses after the process is complete.

!!! caution "Configuring the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}"

      {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} allows developers to manage the app user experience for signing blockchain transactions with {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}. 
      
      The user experience with the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} is configured programmatically through the `alwaysVisible` option. Install the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} and as part of the integration, add code in the app to create a new `AuthProvider` instance. Specify the appropriate wallet visibility mode via the `alwaysVisible` option. See the [[configure-wallet-visibility|{{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} configuration guide]] for details.

!!! info "{{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}"

      The {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} assigned to your application can be found on the top right of the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} screen. ![App Client Identifier](/img/an_db_app_address.png){.an-screenshots}

### Manage Configurations

Every application that is registered using the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} is represented by a single card displayed in the 'Manage Apps' screen, next to the 'Create New App' wizard. Click on the application card to view the application dashboard screen. By default, the application dashboard screen shows application usage details for the 'Testnet' configuration profile and some links to the {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} documentation. 

To view configuration details for an application, use the LHS navigation menu and click *Configure* to view/edit the application configuration settings as described in an earlier section of this guide.

Each application can only be associated with two configuration profiles, 'Testnet' and 'Mainnet'. Both these configurations are maintained separately and each is associated with a unique **{{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}**. 

![New App config card](/img/an_db_new_app_card.png){.an-screenshots}

#### Testnet

By default, all newly registered applications are enabled for using the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} 'Testnet'. Developers can view or edit the default configuration settings by clicking 'Testnet' on the application card displayed in the 'Manage Apps' dashboard screen. This will bring up the application dashboard screen with various navigation options in the LHS pane.

After validation on the 'Testnet', the application can be configured to use the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} 'Mainnet'. To do this, developers must create a corresponding 'Mainnet' configuration profile. 

#### Mainnet

To use the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet, the developers must first create a 'Mainnet' configuration profile using the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}. 

A newly registered application does not have any 'Mainnet' profile associated with it, it has to be explicitly created by the developer. The application card displayed in the 'Manage Apps' screen will show the 'Mainnet' configuration as disabled for all newly registered apps. To create a 'Mainnet' configuration profile, the developer must use the application dashboard screen displaying the Testnet profile, use the LHS navigation pane and select the **Social Auth** settings. 

In the social authentication settings screen, refer to the dropdown on the top right next to 'Testnet'. Use this dropdown to select and switch to the 'Mainnet' configuration.

![Testnet Mainnet Selection](/img/an_db_testnet_mainnet_select.png){.an-screenshots}

When 'Mainnet' is selected from the dropdown, a new 'Mainnet' profile creation wizard gets activated and displays a pop-up screen asking the developer to choose one of the options to create the 'Mainnet' configuration. You can either copy the exact 'Testnet' configuration or create a new blank configuration for 'Mainnet' settings. 

![Switch to Mainnet Profile](/img/an_db_new_mainnet_config_anim.gif){.an-screenshots}

After the selection is made and the developer confirms, the 'Mainnet' profile is created and automatically registered with {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}}. 

!!! note "Mainnet {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}"

      The newly created 'Mainnet' configuration profile is associated with a brand new unique **{{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}**. Developers must specify this new {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} while integrating the application with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} and deploying it on {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} 'Mainnet'.

!!! caution "Copying Testnet Profile"

      If the developer chooses to create the 'Mainnet' profile by copying the 'Testnet' profile, there is an additional setup required to update the configuration of the social provider settings. Once the 'Mainnet' profile is created, click the application configuration social login section in the LHS navigation of the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} and copy the `Redirect URI' displayed for the 'Mainnet' profile. You need to update this `Redirect URI` value from the Testnet ones to the Mainnet ones for the respective social provider. To do this, use the social provider-specific developer console or dashboard.

??? example "Example: Copying Google Profile"
      
      If Google is enabled in your app's 'Testnet' profile, then during the configuration of the social provider with the Google Developer console, the Testnet redirect URI was added.  Copy the 'Mainnet' profile redirect URI value from the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} and update them in the Google Console OAuth settings. 

      Make sure that you add the 'Mainnet' redirect URI value for the other social providers that are enabled in the 'Testnet' profile. This is required for enabling your app to use the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet. 
      
      The figure below shows how the 'redirect URI' is updated in a scenario where Google and Twitch were configured for the 'Testnet' configuration profile and that profile was copied to create a 'Mainnet' profile.

      ![Update redirect URI](/img/an_db_example_add_mainnet_redirect_uri.png){.an-screenshots}

#### Switch Profiles

There are multiple ways to switch an application from using Testnet to Mainnet. 

* To switch from Testnet to the Mainnet profile, use the application dashboard screen, and select **Configuration >> Social Auth** in the LHS navigation pane. Refer to the dropdown next to 'Testnet' on the top RHS of the screen and choose 'Mainnet'. If there is a preexisting 'Mainnet profile, the app is automatically switched to it. You can view the social authentication settings and the assigned **{{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}** for the 'Mainnet' profile. If there is no 'Mainnet' profile associated with the app, then on selecting 'Mainnet' from the dropdown, the app wizard gets activated and assists in creating a 'Mainnet' configuration profile for the application. Once the profile is created, a new **{{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}** is automatically assigned and the configuration switches to 'Mainnet'.

    ![Select Testnet or Mainnet](/img/an_db_testnet_mainnet_select.png){.an-screenshots}  

* If a 'Mainnet' configuration profile is already created for an application, you can also switch between Testnet/Mainnet configuration profiles by using the 'Manage Apps' dashboard screen. Simply select the application card and click on 'Testnet' or 'Mainnet'. This will bring up the application dashboard screen for the selected configuration profile. 

    ![Switch to Testnet](/img/an_db_all_app_card.png){.an-screenshots}

!!! caution

      Depending upon whether the 'Testnet' **{{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}** value or the 'Mainnet' **{{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}** value is used to integrate an application with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}, deployment of the app happens on the respective {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Network. "Testnet" usage is not billed but if an application chooses 'Mainnet' while integrating with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}, it will be billed in the forthcoming releases.

#### Switch Applications

Developers can switch from one application configuration profile screen to another application by using the 'Manage Apps' screen and clicking on the requisite application card. 

Alternatively, you can use the LHS navigation pane in the configuration screen and click on the dropdown next to the application name in the top left. The dropdown displays a list of all the applications registered by the developer and a link to navigate to the *Manage Apps* dashboard screen. Select a different application from the drop-down list and you will be switched to a different application dashboard screen. 

![Switch Application](/img/an_db_switch_application_anim.gif){.an-screenshots}

### Monitor Usage

Developers can monitor their registered application usage statistics via the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}. The *Manage Apps* screen displays the account-level usage metrics. Application-specific usage details are available on the application dashboard screen. 

#### Account Usage Metrics

The *Manage Apps* screen displays Monthly Active Users (MAU) for the developer account. This is an aggregate score across all the applications that are registered for a developer account and configured to use the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet. Any application using the 'Testnet' are not billed and not included in this overall account usage statistic.

![App usage metrics](/img/an_db_metrics.png){.an-screenshots}

!!! caution

      The billing data is only applicable for Mainnet usage and will be made available in the forthcoming releases.

#### Usage per Application

{{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Network maintains per-application usage statistics separately for both the 'Testnet' and 'Mainnet' configuration profiles. 

In the *Manage Apps* dashboard screen, all registered applications are listed as cards. Each application card displays the 'Total Users' statistic. This refers to the total monthly active application users that are utilizing the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet/Mainnet. To view per application usage details, you need to select 'Testnet' or 'Mainnet' profile and look at the application dashboard screen that displays the following usage statistics: 

* Number of logged-in users 

Use the 'Daily' and 'Monthly' tabs to see the respective usage statistics. 

![Application Usage Stats Testnet](/img/an_db_app_usage_metrics_testnet_anim.gif){.an-screenshots}

You can use the dropdown in the top right of the application dashboard screen to select Testnet/Mainnet usage details.

![Application Usage Stats Mainnet](/img/an_db_app_usage_metrics_mainnet_anim.gif){.an-screenshots}

### Billing

{{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} tracks the Mainnet app usage for every developer account in terms of MAU. Invoices are generated at the end of each month and the chargeable amount is auto-deducted using the payment method configured by the developer in their profile section. See [billing and pricing]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/billing.md) for details.

To begin using the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}, the app developers don't need to update the profile details including the billing information. Once the apps consume the free tier of {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet usage, the developer must provide the billing details via the profile section of the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}. Otherwise, the registered apps will be suspended and users will not be allowed to log in to any app that is registered using the developer account.

#### Set up Payment Method

Click on the user icon on the top right of the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} screen. Select **Profile** in the dropdown.
