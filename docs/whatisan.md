Arcana Network is an **EVM-compatible platform** for developers to quickly build **privacy-preserving Web3 applications**. It enables developers to quickly onboard users by simplifying the Web3 onboarding process and making it easy for developers to allow authenticated users to sign blockchain transactions.

Arcana Network offering consists of two key components:

* Developer Dashboard
* Auth SDK
