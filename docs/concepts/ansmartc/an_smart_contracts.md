Arcana smart contracts are typical blockchain contracts. These are programs that encapsulate Arcana Network protocol logic and state information. Arcana smart contracts are deployed and run on the Polygon Network.

Arcana smart contracts define rules that are governed and enforced by Arcana Network. Like any other smart contract, these are deployed once and never deleted. All interactions with Arcana smart contracts are irreversible.

Arcana smart Contracts manage the logic and state for implementing user data privacy and access control. It requires that the dApp user data upload all data into the Arcana Store, as per the dApp configurations.
