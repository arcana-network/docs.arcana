# Upgradable Contracts

{{config.extra.arcana.company_name}}  smart contracts together with the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}}  Gateway implements the core system logic for providing app user data privacy and access control.  Note that a typical smart contract once deployed on the blockchain can never be changed. But {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} smart contract implementation ensures that it can be upgraded.

The primary aim of having multiple smart contracts for {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} is not just to implement and choreograph the core system logic of user data access operations. It also ensures that the {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}}  protocol, in general, is upgradable.
