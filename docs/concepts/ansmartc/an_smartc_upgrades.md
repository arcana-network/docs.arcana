# Upgradable Contracts

Arcana smart contracts together with Arcana Gateway implement the core system logic for providing dApp user data privacy and access control.  Note that a typical smart contract once deployed on the blockchain can never be changed. Then how does Arcana smart contract implementation ensure that it can be upgraded?

The primary aim of having multiple smart contracts for Arcana Network is not just to implement and choreograph the core system logic of user data access operations. It also ensures that the Arcana Network protocol, in general, is upgradable.
