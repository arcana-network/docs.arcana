# Gateway Nodes

The gateway node is an important part of the {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} blockchain protocol. It enables gasless transactions for the Web3 apps that register with {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} through the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} and integrate with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. The gateway node manages app configuration for using the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} and forwards blockchain requests from Web3 apps to the {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} blockchain protocol. After a user authenticates and approves a transaction, the gateway node parses and sends it to the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} blockchain as a meta-transaction. A meta transaction includes the actual initial transaction. Using this approach, signers don't have to pay transaction fees and the gateway node handles payment management.
