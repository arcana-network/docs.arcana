# Usage & Billing

This guide explains the payment model for using {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} in Web3 apps. 

## Pricing

Testnet usage is free!

### Mainnet

Each developer account enjoys a promotional free usage tier. Beyond this free tier, usage costs apply to all apps registered with {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} under a developer account and are invoiced together. Refer to [{{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Pricing](https://www.arcana.network/pricing) for current billing rates and free tier limits.

## Billing Metrics

{{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} monitors app usage with the following metrics:

* **Aggregate App Usage**: This metric tracks the 'Monthly Active Users (MAU)' across all apps registered with {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} per developer account on the Mainnet. Total MAU data includes free and paid usage.

* **Per App Usage**: This metric monitors the 'Daily Active Users (DAU)' and 'Monthly Active Users (MAU)' for individual apps on the Testnet. Data is also available for Mainnet usage per app.

!!! note "Testnet Usage is Free"

      Billing applies only to {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet usage.

## Billing Setup

Using the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}, developers can configure their {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} account by providing essential information. Billing requires the following details:

* Organization
* Billing Address Details
* Payment Method

!!! caution "Adding Payment Method"

      It is a mandatory requirement to enter and save a valid address in your developer account prior to providing payment method details through the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}. 

Once generated, developers can access their billing history and view the current outstanding invoice.

!!! tip "Testnet and Free Tier (Mainnet) Usage"

     Payment setup isn't needed for Testnet usage or for using the Mainnet's free tier. Web3 apps can integrate with {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} for Testnet without it. However, after exhausting the free tier, setting up payment is essential for uninterrupted user onboarding on {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet.

## Billing Cycle

{{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet usage beyond the free tier is billed **monthly**. Invoices are generated on the last day of each month, summarizing the collective app usage and charges for all apps under a developer account. Access invoice and usage specifics through {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} by clicking on the user icon on the top right and selecting **Invoices**.

## Outstanding Dues

Outstanding dues must be paid in full; partial payments are not accepted.

Invoices factor in all promotional and free-tier MAU usage across registered apps for a developer account. Payment is due upon monthly invoice generation, with a notification sent to the developer. Payment is automatically deducted via the configured method. If payment fails, there's a 21-day grace period, with retry attempts every 7 days. During this period, registered apps function normally. After the grace period, if payment remains unsuccessful, the developer account is suspended, barring user access to registered apps.

Inactivity and non-payment for 3 months **may**result in app deletion and account termination."

## Billing Notifications

For billing notifications, refer to the bell icon on the top right of the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} screen.

| Event  | Notification | Notes |
| :---  | :--- | :--- |
| Billing | Add card details for processing the payment. | The first time a developer logins, this message is displayed in the notifications section. |

| Billing | Payment successfully processed for this month. | Once the free-tier is over, monthly invoices are raised and payment automatically deducted from the specified payment method. |
| Billing | Payment has been declined.| This notification will be displayed if the specified payment method fails when the invoice dues are processed, or if there are any payment errors due to insufficient funds. |
