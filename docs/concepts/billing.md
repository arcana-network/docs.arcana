# Usage & Billing

{{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} tracks app usage in terms of 'Monthly Active Users (MAU) across all the apps registered with {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} for a developer account. Web3 app developers can monitor registered app usage for both the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet as well as Mainnet by using the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}. Only {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet usage is billed. 

There is a promotional free usage tier available for each developer account. Once this free tier is used up, usage is chargeable for all the apps registered with {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} for a developer account and billed via a single invoice. See [{{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Pricing](https://www.arcana.network/pricing) for the latest billing charges and available free tier limits.

### Billing Cycle

Beyond the free tier, the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet usage for all the registered apps in the developer account is charged. The billing cycle is **monthly**.

A single invoice is raised for every developer account on the last day of every calendar month. It contains the aggregate app usage and billing details for all the apps in that account put together.  Developer can use the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} to view the invoice and usage details.

### Outstanding Dues

The invoice for a developer account is generated taking into consideration all the promotional, and free-tier usage in terms of MAU across all the registered apps for that account. The amount is due once the monthly invoice is raised. A notification is sent to the registered email and the amount is automatically deducted based on the payment method configured by the developer. If the selected payment method fails, a grace period is allowed during which automatic payment is retried. During the grace period, the registered apps become suspended and no users are allowed to log in and use the apps.

All pending dues must be paid in one shot and there is no part-payment allowed. After 3 months of inactivity / non-payment of pending dues, and failure to pay via the configured payment method, all the apps registered for the defaulter account are deleted and the developer account is suspended.

## Billing Setup

Developers can use the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} to set up their {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} account with the following details. The address and payment method details are required for billing.

* Organization details
* Address
* Payment Method

!!! caution "Adding Payment Method"

      It is mandatory to add a valid address and save it in the developer account **before** adding the payment method specifics using the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}. 

Developers can view the billing history and the current outstanding invoice once the invoice is generated.

!!! tip "Payment method not required for free tier usage"

     It is not mandatory to enter the billing details in the developer's account profile to use the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. Once the free tier usage is consumed, the developer is required to add the billing details to the profile and ensure uninterrupted user onboarding for the registered, active Web3 apps that are using the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet.
