# Usage & Billing

{{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} tracks app usage in terms of 'Monthly Active Users (MAU) across all the apps deployed by a developer account on the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet as well as the Mainnet. Billing is done only for {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet usage.

There is a promotional free usage tier after which billing is chargeable. For the latest details, see [{{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Pricing](https://www.arcana.network/pricing).

Developers can use the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} to set up their {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} account with the required details used for billing the registered app usage.

### Billing Cycle

Beyond the free tier, all usage by the registered apps in the developer account is charged for using the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet. On the last day of each month, the invoice with usage details and applicable charges is generated and can be viewed by the developer using the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}.

### Outstanding Dues

The monthly invoice for a developer account is generated taking into consideration all the promotional, and free-tier usage in terms of MAU across all the registered apps for that account. The amount is due once the monthly invoice is raised. A notification is sent to the registered email and the amount is automatically deducted based on the payment method configured by the developer. If the selected payment method fails, a grace period is allowed during which automatic payment is retried. During the grace period, the registered apps become suspended and no users are allowed to log in and use the apps.

All pending dues must be paid in one shot and there is no part-payment allowed. After 3 months of inactivity / non-payment of pending dues, and failure to pay via the configured payment method, all the apps registered for the defaulter account are deleted and the developer account is suspended.
