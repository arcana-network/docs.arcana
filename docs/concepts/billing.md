# Usage & Billing

Arcana Network tracks app usage in terms of 'Monthly Active Users'(MAU) across all the apps deployed by a developer account on the Arcana Testnet as well as the Mainnet networks.  Billing is done only for the Arcana Mainnet usage.

There is a promotional free usage tier after which billing is effective. For the latest details, see [Arcana Pricing](https://www.arcana.network/pricing).

Developers can use the Arcana Developer Dashboard to set up their Arcana Network account with preferred billing methods, name, address and other details that show up on the invoice. They can view billing history, estimated charges and pay their outstanding dues using the dashboard.

## Outstanding Dues

At the end of every month, the bill is generated for every developer account taking into consideration all the promotional, free usage in terms of MAU. A notification is sent and the amount automatically deducted based on the preferred payment method selected by the developer. If the selected payment method fails, a grace period is allowed during which automatic payment is tried again and the account owner notified of the same.

All pending dues must be paid in one shot and there is no part-payment allowed. After 3 months of inactivity / non-payment of pending dues, all the apps registered for the defaulter account are deleted.
