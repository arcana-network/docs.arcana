# Social Login

Social Logins eliminate the friction of setting up and managing wallets for new users, who mightâ€™ve dropped off the onboarding journey. It simplifies the onboarding process for new users by using familiar social authentication providers or email, making it super easy.

Custodial wallets also offer social login, but they require users to sacrifice privacy and control, as a third party can access your keys and wallet funds.

Arcana's non-custodial wallet is user-friendly, offering simplicity to new users while prioritizing user privacy, security, and ownership.

The Arcana Auth SDK offers social login via email, Web2 authentication providers such as Google, GitHub, Discord, and Twitter, and third-party IAM providers such as Firebase and Cognito.
