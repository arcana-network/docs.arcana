# Authentication

Authentication in the Web3 ecosystem is more complex than in traditional Web2 applications. Users must have a private key to interact with blockchain and cryptographic systems. This can be cumbersome for users, as generating and managing private keys can be difficult and there is no central authority for recovery if a key is lost. Web3 wallets can make this process easier, but they are a new concept for many Web2 users and managing secrets for the wallet can be an additional burden. This can make it difficult for new users to onboard Web3 applications and the onboarding experience is different from that of Web2 applications.

**Arcana's [Auth SDK]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/authsdk.md) significantly reduces the barriers to user authentication and simplifies the process of signing blockchain transactions by eliminating the need for key management.** 

## Authentication Mechanisms

Web3 application developers can [plug in default UI]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/plugnplayauth.md) for user login or build their own UI and call Auth SDK functions to enable one or more authentication mechanisms:

* [Social authentication]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/authtype/socialauth.md)
* [Passwordless authentication]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/authtype/pwdless.md)

!!! note

      Arcana's [Auth SDK]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/authsdk.md) allows developers to enable authenticated users to sign blockchain transactions. 
      
      It includes the [Arcana wallet]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/anwallet/index.md), which provides a standard Ethereum provider interface for securely enabling blockchain transactions. Arcana's `AuthProvider` encapsulates a decentralized key generated by Arcana's asynchronous, distributed key generation ([DKG]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/dkg/index.md)) protocol. After users are authenticated through social or passwordless login mechanisms, developers can use the provider to enable them to securely sign blockchain transactions.
