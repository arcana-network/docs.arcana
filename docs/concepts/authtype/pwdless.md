With Arcana Auth, users can easily onboard any Web3 application with passwordless authentication simply by providing an email ID. 

Application users receive an email verification link or a time-sensitive OTP that can be used to log in to the application. This passwordless approach eliminates the need to remember passwords or share social account identifiers with the application provider, making the onboarding process completely friction-free. 

!!! note

      After passwordless authentication, developers can enable users to access the embedded Web3 Arcana wallet included with the Auth SDK to sign blockchain transactions.
