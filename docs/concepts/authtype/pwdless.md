With the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}, users can easily onboard any Web3 app in a passwordless manner by simply providing an email ID. 

App users receive an email verification link or a time-sensitive OTP that can be used to log in to the application. This passwordless approach eliminates the need to remember passwords or share social account identifiers to onboard an app, making the onboarding process completely frictionless.
