The  {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} offers a passwordless onboarding option for Web3 apps. Users provide their email ID and receive a verification link (or OTP) via email, simplifying the login process. This eliminates the need for password management and social account sharing, streamlining onboarding.
