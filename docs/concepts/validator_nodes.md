# Validator Nodes

Validator nodes play a crucial role in ensuring the decentralization of the Arcana Network. These partner infrastructure nodes participate in the distributed key generation ([DKG]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/dkg/index.md)) protocol, which is used by the Arcana Auth SDK to generate keys for signing blockchain transactions. 

Of the seven nodes in the DKG subsystem, four are owned and operated by Arcana, while the remaining nodes are run by trusted partners.
