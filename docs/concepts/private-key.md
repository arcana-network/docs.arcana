# Private Key 

A private key is a secret linked to the user's {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}. It is generated by the asynchronous distributed key generator ([ADKG]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/adkg.md)) component of the protocol used by the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. [[faq-auth#user-key-privacy|Only the user can access it]].

Users can export their private key securely via the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI. The user is responsible for securing the exported key.
