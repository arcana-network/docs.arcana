# Chain Abstraction (CA)

{% include "./text-snippets/ca/what_is_ca.md" %}

## Why Chain Abstraction?

Chain Abstraction removes the friction of users having to bridge across different blockchains to try apps. Users get a single, unified balance of their assets across multiple chains and can seamlessly spend them on your app, on the chain it is built on.

With Chain Abstraction, users no longer need to:

- Figure out which chain your app runs on
- Hunt for the best bridge to move assets
- Fund gas tokens on different chains
- Track and transfer balances across chains
