# Validator Nodes

Validator nodes play a crucial role in ensuring the decentralization of the {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} key generation protocol. These partner infrastructure nodes participate in the distributed key generation ([DKG]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/dkg/index.md)) protocol, which is used by the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} to generate keys for signing blockchain transactions. 

Of the seven nodes in the DKG subsystem, four are owned and operated by {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}}, while the remaining nodes are run by trusted partners. 

For more information, consult the see [{{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Technical Whitepaper](https://www.notion.so/Arcana-Technical-Docs-a1d7fd0d2970452586c693e4fee14d08).
