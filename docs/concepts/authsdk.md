The Arcana Auth SDK integrates with Web3 applications and allows them to quickly onboard users. It offers an embedded, non-custodial Web3 wallet that enables authenticated users to sign blockchain transactions on any EVM-compatible network. 

Developers must first use the [Arcana Developer Dashboard]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/dashboard.md) and [register, configure]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/config_dapp.md) their application. Each registered application is assigned a unique **App Address** required for integrating with the Auth SDK.
