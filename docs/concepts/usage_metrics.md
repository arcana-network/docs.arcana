# Application Usage Metrics

Arcana Developer Dashboard tracks the following application usage metrics:

* Aggregate Monthly Active Users (MAU) for all applications that are registered by a dev account to use the 'Mainnet'
* Per application usage metrics
  - Total number of logged in users (MAU) that are using the 'Mainnet'
  - Logged in users (Daily, Monthly) for 'Testnet'/'Mainnet'

The number of logged in users is tracked separately for the 'Testnet' and 'Mainnet' application profiles.

!!! note

      The dashboard shows the total number of active users for a specific dApp network profile. It does not show real time user login metrics in the current release.
