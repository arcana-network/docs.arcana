# Private Key 

The private key is a secret associated with a user's Arcana wallet and is generated using a distributed key generator ([DKG]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/dkg/index.md)). It cannot be accessed by anyone other than the user. The Arcana wallet allows users to export their private key if they want to access their data or assets using a different wallet. However, the private key is not removed from the Arcana Network after it is exported.
