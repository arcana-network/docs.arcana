# Gateway Node

The gateway node is a vital part of the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} protocol. It manages interactions with the protocol via the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}, overseeing SDK usage and app configuration settings. It uses [meta transaction](http://www.arcana.network/blog/a-quick-guide-to-understand-meta-transactions) to handle the blockchain transactions and contract interactions issued by the Web3 apps.
