# Gasless App: Onboard Users

In this guide, you will learn how {{page.meta.arcana.app_type}} Web3 apps can integrate with the [{{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/authsdk.md) onboard users and allow authenticated users to perform gasless transactions.

Developers can choose to onboard users by either using the built-in plug-and-play login UI provided by the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} or a build a custom login UI. Once a user onboards the app, they can instantly access the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} within the app context. Developers must configure gasless operations and set up gas tanks through the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} prior to integrating the app with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}.

## Prerequisites

* Make sure you can access the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}: {% include "./text-snippets/db_portal_url.md" %}

* Use the [{{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/dashboard.md) to [[index-configure-auth|register and configure the app]]. The plug-and-play pop-up UI screen will display only those authentication providers that are configured using the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}.  If no authentication providers are configured in the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}, then users can only onboard the app via the passwordless login option. See [[index-configure-auth|how to configure authentication providers]] for details.
  
* Follow the instructions as per the app type and [[index-integrate|integrate the app]] with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} before accessing user onboarding functions of the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}.

* **Make sure you configure gasless operations through the dashboard.** See [[configure-gasless|how to set up gas tanks and deposit funds]] to enable gasless transactions in apps that are integrated with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}.

!!! an-caution "Gasless Transactions"

      The {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} has a built-in gasless feature that can be used to enable gasless transactions in the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} for apps that integrate with the SDK.

      If you are looking at **only** enabling gasless transactions in third-party browser-based wallets and do not require social login, {{config.extra.arcana.gasless_sdk_name}}.

## Steps

*Onboarding users and enabling gasless transactions through the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} is simple!*

Just a single line of code!

### Option 1: Onboarding via plug-and-Play Login UI

After successfully integrating the app with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}, make sure the `AuthProvider` is successfully initialized. Then simply add a single line of code, call to the `connect` function of the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} and enable the built-in plug-and-play login UI in the app when a user clicks a button to log in:

{% include "./code-snippets/auth_plugnplay.md" %}

The `connect()` function will bring up the plug-and-play pop-up modal in the app context and display the available options for user onboarding. Only those options are displayed that were earlier configured by the developer using the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}.

The figure below shows the plug-and-play login UI screen for a test app. All the authentication providers configured by the developer are available as the onboarding options. The passwordless login option is enabled by default.

     {% include "./text-snippets/jwt_token.md" %}

!!! an-warning "No plug-and-play support for Firebase authentication."

      {% include "./text-snippets/warn_firebase_no_pnp.md" %}

That is all! :material-party-popper:

When a user logs into the app with established gas tanks, whitelisted app operations, and deposited funds from the developer or sponsor, all allowed actions using {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} don't incur gas fees.

### Option 2: Onboarding via custom Login UI

Alternatively, developers can use [[index-custom-ui-onboard-users|custom login UI]] to onboard users via one of the supported social login mechanisms.

That is all! :material-party-popper:

When a user logs into the app with established gas tanks, whitelisted app operations, and deposited funds from the developer or sponsor, all allowed actions using {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} don't incur gas fees.

!!! an-warning "No plug-and-play support for Firebase authentication."

      {% include "./text-snippets/warn_firebase_no_pnp.md" %}

## What's Next?

Use the EIP-1193 provider offered by the SDK to call JSON/RPC functions and other supported web3 wallet operations in the authenticated user's context.
