# Auth SDK v0.3.0 -> v{% include "./text-snippets/latest_auth_sdk.md" %} Migration

This guide is meant for developers who have already integrated apps with an older version of the Arcana Auth SDK and run them using Arcana Network Testnet. If you are new to Arcana Network, please visit [Quick Start Guide]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/walletsdk/wallet_qs.md) to get started.

When you migrate from using the Arcana Auth SDK v0.3.0 to the latest v{% include "./text-snippets/latest_auth_sdk.md" %} release, please note that simply upgrading the SDK will not suffice.

There are a few breaking changes that require you to use Arcana Developer Dashboard and re-register, re-configure the app settings as per the latest Auth SDK configuration setting requirements, and obtain a new **App Address**. Only then you can re-integrate the app successfully with the latest Auth SDK. 

That's all. There are no further Auth SDK function changes in this latest release.

## What has Changed?

The following section lists changes between v0.3.0 and v{% include "./text-snippets/latest_auth_sdk.md" %}. 

!!! caution 

      If you are using v 0.2.2 or older, please see [How to migrate to Auth SDK v0.3.0]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/migration/beta_auth_v0.3.0_migration.md).

### Developer Dashboard

#### Mainnet Configuration Profile

* By default, when any new application is registered and configured, a 'Testnet' profile is created. From this release onward, there is a new provision for creating a 'Mainnet' configuration profile as well for the app. Developers can create a Mainnet profile and switch to using the Arcana Mainnet. Or they can run two instances of their app, one on Arcana Testnet using the 'Testnet' configuration profile and the other on Arcana Mainnet using the `Mainnet' configuration profile for say production usage.

* To create the 'Mainnet' profile you can choose to copy the existing 'Testnet' profile or create a new 'Mainnet' configuration profile. Note that a unique, **new App Address** is assigned to the 'Mainnet' profile whether it is copied or created afresh.

* To deploy an app on Arcana Mainnet, developers are required to perform two things:
   
    - First, use the dashboard to create a 'Mainnet' configuration profile for the app and obtain a **new App Address**.
    - Second, the developers must also re-integrate their app and update the code where they instantiate the `AuthProvider` appropriately so that 'Mainnet' **App Address** is used and `network` is initialized as `mainnet` in the `AuthProvider` constructor.

#### Mainnet Deployment Keyspace

* The 'Mainnet' configuration profile for the app has an additional setting meant for the selecting the **Keyspace** type. Developers can choose between the default **App-specific Keys** or **Global Keys**. [Global Keyspace]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/sharedkeys.md) enables a better user experience whereby the user is assigned the same wallet address across applications in the Arcana ecosystem in a secure manner. Enabling the global keys feature requires developer verification and whitelisting. This offers higher security than the global keys option. For details, see ['How to Configure Keyspace']({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/db/config_dApp_with_db.md#configure-mainnet-keyspace) section in the Dashboard User Guide.

#### Usage Tracking

* In this release, the Developer Dashboard tracks application usage data in terms of MAU.  Billing is done at the end of the month **only** for Mainnet usage. For 'Testnet' usage there is per-application MAU tracking but no billing or charges are levied.

### Auth SDK

The latest Auth SDK supports deploying apps on the Arcana Mainnet.

To use Arcana Mainnet, you need to first login into the Arcana Developer dashboard, create a 'Mainnet' configuration profile for your app and choose the requisite 'Keyspace' type. In addition to creating the 'Mainnet' configuration profile, developers need to update the Auth SDK integration code for creating a new `AuthProvider`:

* Use the **App Address** specified to the 'Mainnet' configuration profile in the dashboard
* Set the `network` parameter in the `AuthProvider` constructor to 'mainnet'

Refer to the next section for step-by-step instructions on how to migrate from using an older Auth SDK to the v{% include "./text-snippets/latest_auth_sdk.md" %}.

## How to Migrate to v1.0.1?

*Do not jump into installing, or upgrading the Auth SDK in your sources and running your app.*

To successfully use the latest Auth SDK, you need to first **re-create your app configuration profile** using the Arcana Dashboard and then integrate your app with the latest Auth SDK for onboarding users and enabling Arcana wallet. 

If you wish to deploy your app on Arcana Testnet, simply follow steps 1 and 3.  To deploy your app on Arcana Mainnet, follow all three steps:

1. **Reconfigure & Get App Address**: If you are using v0.3.0, you would already have created a 'Testnet' configuration profile for your app. When you log into the dashboard, this profile will not show up by default. Due to breaking changes in the latest Auth SDK release, you will be required to re-register your app using the Arcana Dashboard. When you re-register and create a new profile for the app, by default, it is assigned as a 'Testnet' configuration. This step is mandatory irrespective of whether you want to deploy your app on Arcana Testnet or Mainnet or both.

2. **Mainnet Configuration**: To deploy your app on the Arcana Mainnet, you must create a 'Mainnet' configuration profile using the Arcana Developer Dashboard. See instructions [here]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/db/config_dApp_with_db.md#example-new-mainnet-authprovider). Once you have the 'Mainnet' configuration profile ready, copy the new **App Address** assigned to the 'Mainnet' configuration profile. This will be required during Auth SDK integration later. At the time of 'Mainnet' profile creation, you need to specify whether you would like to use the **App-specific Keys** (default) or use the **Global Keys** feature for your app. To enable the global keys feature, developers must submit a verification form and get approval. Wait to onboard users until you receive a response for your verification request. Otherwise, the wallet address assigned to your app users may change after **Global Keys** feature takes effect. If you do not choose **Global Keys**, your 'Mainnet' profile is configured to use **App-specific** keys by default.  What this means is that your app users will see different wallet addresses across different apps in the Arcana ecosystem. For details, see [Global Keys]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/sharedkeys.md).

    !!! danger "Update Redirect URI for Mainnet"
  
          You must update the OAuth redirect URI values for all the social providers configured for your 'Mainnet' profile. Use the respective social provider console to update callback URL values for Mainnet. Simply copy the new **redirect URI** value from the application's 'Mainnet' configuration settings dashboard page and add it to the list of redirect URIs setup in the OAuth configuration settings for your provider.  You would have earlier added the redirect URI for the 'Testnet' configuration profile, now simply update the 'Mainnet' URI too. That's all.

3. **Install & Integrate**: Install and upgrade the Auth SDK to v{% include "./text-snippets/latest_auth_sdk.md" %}. Integrate the Auth SDK and initialize the `AuthProvider` by specifying the **App Address** for the selected Arcana Network - Testnet/Mainnet. By default, the `network` parameter is set to â€˜testnetâ€™. Refer to the examples below to see how to integrate your app for using Arcana Testnet and Mainnet.

### Example: Deploy on Testnet
   
Register your app using the Arcana Developer Dashboard. By default, the 'Testnet' configuration profile is created. You can provide the social provider settings as per your user onboarding requirements. Save the **App Address** assigned to your app displayed on the top right of the dashboard screen. This will be required during integration with the Auth SDK as shown below:
   
{% include "./code-snippets/init_auth_testnet.md" %}
   
Once a user authenticates, the following wallet UI is displayed when the app is deployed on the Arcana Testnet.
      
<img alt="Testnet Wallet" src="/img/an_migration_testnet_wallet.png" width="40%"/>
  
### Example: Deploy on Mainnet

Register your app using the Arcana Developer Dashboard. By default, the 'Testnet' configuration profile is created. Make sure you create a 'Mainnet' profile and save the **App Address** assigned to your app for the 'Mainnet' configuration. It is displayed on the top right of the dashboard screen.

To bring up your app on Arcana Mainnet, in your integration code, use the `Mainnet` **App Address** and specify the `network` parameter as 'mainnet' while instantiating the `AuthProvider` as shown below:
   
{% include "./code-snippets/init_auth_mainnet.md" %}
   
Once a user authenticates, the following wallet UI is displayed when the app is deployed on the Arcana Mainnet.
   
<img alt="Mainnet Wallet" src="/img/an_migration_mainnet_wallet.png" width="40%"/>

Besides Testnet/Mainnet and Global Keyspace features, the latest Auth SDK uses a new, improved ADKG subsystem. In addition to the DKG nodes operated by Arcana, two nodes are run and managed by Comdex and LugaNodes.
