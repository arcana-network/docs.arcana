Using an older version and want to migrate? Read on...

## What has Changed?

In this release there are **no usage changes** from the previous version of the SDK.

This new release includes support for Web3 gaming apps based on the Unity framework, support for MultiversX chain in the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}, and minor bug fixes.

## How to Migrate to v1.0.10?

Install the latest {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} v1.0.10. No integration code updates are required for the features in the previous release.  

### MultiversX Support

If you wish to use this new release and add support for MultiversX in your app, there may be some changes related to the [[mvx-dashboard-user-guide|configuration of MultiversX]] as the default chain in the dashboard. Note that the [[mvx-web3-wallet-ops|supported Web3 wallet operations for the MultiversX chain]] are different from those for the EVM-compatible chains. See [[mvx-quick-start| MultiversX Quick Start Guide]] for more details.

That's all!
