# Arcana Auth v1.0.3 -> v1.0.4 

This guide is meant for developers who have already integrated apps with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} v1.0.3 and run them using Arcana Network Testnet. If you are new to Arcana Network, please visit [Quick Start Guide]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/walletsdk/wallet_qs.md) to get started.

## What has Changed?

There are no usage changes. 

## How to Migrate to Arcana Auth v1.0.4?

To use the latest {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} product release v1.0.4, developers don't need to upgrade the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} or change any code in the integrated apps. 

**You can continue to use the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} v1.0.3 package.** 

All the changes in {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} release v1.0.4 are related to the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} and {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI components. 

Apps that have already integrated with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} v1.0.3 package should work as is. There should be no change in the user's wallet address when using the Arcana Testnet or Mainnet.

!!! note "Using older releases?"

      If you have integrated Web3 app with an older version of the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} than the version v1.0.3, please refer to the [Migration Guides]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/migration/index.md) and follow the instructions to upgrade to {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} v1.0.3 release.
