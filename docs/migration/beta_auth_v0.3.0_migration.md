# Auth SDK v0.2.x -> v0.3.0 Migration

When you migrate from an older version of the Arcana Auth SDK to v0.3.0, or later there are some breaking changes. These changes are mostly related to how developers configure and integrate the apps. There are no breaking changes in the user onboarding or blockchain transaction signing functions.  The Arcana wallet has a revamped, better UI in this release.

## What has Changed?

* This release **does not** contain Arcana Storage SDK. 

* Arcana Blockchain is no longer listed in the list of available blockchain networks in the Arcana wallet dropdown.

* You can use the Auth SDK for user onboarding and signing blockchain transactions on any supported EVM-compatible chain.

* All blockchain transaction activity is no longer available as a tab in the main Arcana wallet main screen. Refer to the newly added combined notification screen in the Arcana wallet.

### Developer Dashboard

* There were some breaking changes in the registered application database schema. If you were already using older version of the Auth SDK, you need to re-register and configure your application again. Your application **App Address** will change as a result of re-registration. Make sure you use the new **App Address** while integrating with the Auth SDK.

* There is no usage change in the Auth SDK in this release. 
* After re-registering your app, the dashboard will assign a new **App Address**. You need to use this during integration with the Auth SDK.

## How to Migrate to v0.3.0

1. You need to re-register your app using the Arcana Developer Dashboard. This is required to obtain a fresh **App Address** and use that for integrating with the Auth SDK. Older **App Address** will **NOT WORK** with v0.3.0 release. Follow instructions in the [How to Configure App Guide]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/config_dapp.md) to re-configure your app.

2. If you were using the Arcana Storage SDK, it is no longer supported. The latest Arcana Network platform release comprises of only the Auth SDK and the Developer Dashboard. You need to stop using Storage SDK in your app for the time being until we begin supporting Storage SDK in a future release.

3. You need to [re-integrate your app with the Auth SDK]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/integrate_auth/index.md) by providing the renewed **App Address** after re-configuring your application using the developer dashboard.

4. If you were using **Arcana Testnet** network while instantiating the `AuthProvider` or in wallet operations, you will need to remove this network altogether as it no longer exists.  The Arcana Network Testnet Explorer too is no longer available.  Arcana Network smart contracts are deployed on Polygon now. In this release Arcana wallet supports all EVM-compatible chains besides the default ones that show in the drop down list.  Use the [Wallet User Guide]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/wallet_ui.md) and the [Wallet Developer Guide]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/arcana_wallet/index.md) to add and switch networks using the wallet UI or programmatically.

5. In older release the token transactions were listed in the activity tab.  That tab is no longer there but we now have a new feature 'combined notification screen'. Refer to the [notification tab]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/wallet_ui.md#wallet-notifications) in the wallet to see all the send token, contract deployment and interaction transactions performed by the wallet user.

The new improved Auth SDK now supports NFT preview, transactions and management of NFT collections. A new combined notification screen displays blockchain transactions related to smart contracts, tokens as well as NFTs. For details, see [Auth SDK release notes]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/relnotes/rn_beta_auth_v0.3.0.md).
