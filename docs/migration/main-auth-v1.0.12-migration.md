# Arcana Auth SDK v{{config.extra.arcana.previous_version}} -> v1.0.12 Migration

New to Arcana Network? Get started with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} Quick Start Guides. 

Using an older version and want to migrate? Read on...

## What has Changed?

If you are already using the SDK, there are no usage changes in this release.

This new release includes support for Custom Auth and wallet UI features for off-ramping crypto to fiat.

## How to Migrate to v1.0.12?

Install and upgrade to the latest {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} v1.0.12. No integration code updates are required for the features in the previous release.  

If you plan on using the Passkeys, check out the section about [[concept-auth-passkeys|Passkeys]] and [[onboard-passkey-auth|how to onboard users via passkeys]] in apps integrated with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. See how to set up user onboarding via [[index-config-social-providers|Telegram, Apple]] in the setup section of the documentation. Then refer to the usage section for [[sdk-installation|how to install the SDK, integrate app and onboard users]] depending upon the app type.

That's all!
