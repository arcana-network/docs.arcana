# Migrating to v0.0.24

This is the very first release of the {{config.extra.arcana.gasless_sdk_name}}.

Apps that are already using the built-in gasless feature of the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} to enable gasless transactions through the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} can continue to use the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} with no changes at all.

Apps that require to enable gasless transactions in third-party, browser-based wallets must install and integrate with the newly released {{config.extra.arcana.gasless_sdk_name}}. For details, see [[gasless-standalone-quick-start|how to enable gasless transactions in third-party wallets]]. See `sample-gasless-metamask-only` and `sample-gasless-multi-wallet` submodules in the GitHub repo [Auth Examples](https://github.com/arcana-network/auth-examples).
