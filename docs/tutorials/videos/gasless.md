# Gasless Transactions

Developers can use the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} to [[configure-auth|register and configure app]] and set up gasless transactions. The {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} supports gasless transactions that allow app users to perform blockchain transactions with zero gas fees on the supported EVM-compatible chains.
