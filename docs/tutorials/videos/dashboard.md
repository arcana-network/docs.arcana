# Dashboard

Developers can use the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} to [[register-app-auth|register the app]] and [[index-configure-auth|configure SDK usage]]. Registering the app with {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} associates a unique {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} that is needed for integrating the app with the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} SDKs.
