# Integrate React App

Depending upon whether your React Web3 app is a simple React app or a React app that uses [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) or [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/), you may need to install one or more of the following {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} packages - `auth`, `auth-react`, and `auth-wagmi`.

* If your application is built using the React framework, you need to install both the [`auth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcana/auth) package and the [`auth-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcana/auth-react) package. Next, you must integrate the app with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}, instantiate and initialize the `AuthProvider` and also use the React component, `ProvideAuth`. 
* If your application uses Wagmi or RainbowKit, you need to install and integrate the app only with the [`auth-wagmi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcana/auth-wagmi) wrapper package and create an `ArcanaConnector` to enable user onboarding and signing of blockchain transactions using the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}.

For detailed instructions, select **one of the options below** as per your application type.
