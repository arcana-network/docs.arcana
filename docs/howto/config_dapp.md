# Configure Application

In this tutorial, you will learn how to register and configure an application before integrating it with the Auth SDK. 

!!! note "Configure first, integrate later"

    By using the [Arcana Developer Dashboard]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/dashboard.md) to register and configure applications, Web3 application developers can control the user onboarding experience and the blockchain transaction signing experience.
    
    As part of application registration and configuration, each application is assigned a unique identifier called **App Address**. The **App Address** is required later to [integrate an application]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/integrate_auth/index.md) with the Arcana Auth SDK. 

## Prerequisites

{% include "./text-snippets/db_prerequisites.md" %}

## Step 1: Developer Dashboard Login

{% include "./text-snippets/db_login.md" %}

## Step 2: Register Application

{% include "./text-snippets/db_register_dapp.md" %}

## Step 3: Configure Application

{% include "./text-snippets/db_settings.md" %}

---

You can reconfigure application settings for Auth SDK usage later anytime by visiting the Arcana Developer Dashboard and clicking on the **Configure** menu item on the top right of the screen.

That is all! üéâ

You have successfully registered and configured your application. 

!!! caution "Wallet Visibility Mode"

    {% include "./text-snippets/warn_config_wallet_ui.md" %}

To delete the application entry, visit the **Manage Apps** screen on the developer dashboard.

Use **Delete** to remove the application entry and de-register it.

## What's next?

After registering and configuring the application, install the Auth SDK and then [integrate it with the application]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/integrate_auth/index.md) to enable user authentication and signing of Web3 blockchain transactions.

!!! note

    You can copy the assigned **App Address** once an application is registered and configured using the dashboard. It will be required when you integrate the application with the Auth SDK.
