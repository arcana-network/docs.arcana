# Export Private Key 

This guide explains how a web3 user can export their private key by using the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI. 

!!! caution "Security Risk"

     Exporting a private key from the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} is risky as it exposes user keys in clear text. Do not share private keys with anyone, including anyone from the Arcana Network team.

     While exporting keys using the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI, make sure no one else can see or capture a screenshot while you retrieve your private key from the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} screen.

## Prerequisites

* To use the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}, users must log in to a Web3 app that is integrated with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. 

* Depending on the [type of blockchain signing experience]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/howto/arcana_wallet/config_walletvisibility.md) set up by the app developer, the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} may appear only when a blockchain transaction is triggered, or it may be visible at all times once the user logs in.

## Steps 

Click the **User Profile** tab in the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} screen. Under the 'Private Key' section, you will see the **Export Key** option.

When a user selects **Export Key**, you will see the following confirmation screen:

If the user chooses to **Proceed**, two options are available to export the key. Users can either copy or download the private key from the wallet screen.

After successfully copying or downloading the key, the user **must** close the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} screen by clicking on **Done**. 

!!! note "Security and Privacy"

      The user's private keys are visible only to the authenticated user via the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} screen, on demand. It cannot be accessed by the app developer. Arcana Network does not store any keys. The key shares are generated by the distributed key generation subsystem in the Arcana Network and the user's private key is assembled using these key shares on the user's device locally.

      Once exported, keeping the private key safe is the responsibility of the user. 

**That is all!**  :material-party-popper:

*You are all set to use the exported private keys.*
