# Chain Abstraction

Welcome!

Use Arcana Chain Abstraction (CA) SDK to empower Web3 app users to cross the multi-chain chasm with [[concept-casdk#unified-balance|unified balance]]  across chains and spend anywhere without bridging.

{==

**TL;DR**

Head to the [[ca-quick-start|Quick start Guide]] and begin integrating Web3 app with the SDK. See integration examples for sample code. 

==}

## Why Integrate?

The rise of L2s has fragmented liquidity across multiple chains, making it hard for users to manage funds. Without chain abstraction, users are forced to bridge assets manually â€” a complex, time-consuming process, especially for newcomers. This makes onboarding millions (or billions) of users to Web3 an uphill battle.

Chain abstraction solves this by offering a unified balance. Users can access and spend funds across multiple chains without manual bridging. This reduces friction, lowers entry barriers, and simplifies the user experience.

### Why it matters?

Not all Web3 users have the knowledge, patience, or resources to track down the best routes for liquidity. With chain abstraction, that complexity disappears. Users get seamless access to liquidity on any chain, boosting accessibility for both new apps and new users.

### Proven Tech

Arcana's Chain Abstraction (CA) tech is already working with apps like Aave, UniSwap, and others. Developers can use the beta SDK to enable unified balances in their apps, streamlining the user experience and making Web3 as simple as Web2.
