## {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} CA SDKs

Developers can enable [[concept-unified-balance|unified balance]] in any dApp by installing and integrating it with the appropriate {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} [[ca-sdk-installation|CA SDK flavor as per the app type]].

Unified balance is supported across the following chains and tokens. We are actively working on adding support to enable unified balance across newer chains and tokens.

## {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} CA Wallet (Standalone)

Besides the SDK, we offer a standalone {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Wallet with **Chain Abstraction** [download here]({{config.extra.arcana.ca_wallet_download_url}}). This wallet supports [[concept-unified-balance|unified balance]] across many chains and tokens. Refer to the supported chains and tokens list below.

Currently, it works with a limited set of Web3 apps. We are actively working to expand app support in our CA wallet.
