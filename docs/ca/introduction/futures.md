# Futures

We have [[ca-demo|demonstrated]] Chain Abstraction technology through a standalone Arcana Wallet ([download here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/arcana-wallet/nieddmedbnibfkfokcionggafcmcgkpi)). It allows [[ca-top#unified-balance|unified balance]] across the chains and tokens listed below.

## Chains
      
{% include "./text-snippets/ca_supported_chains.md" %}

## Tokens

{% include "./text-snippets/ca_supported_tokens.md" %}

!!! an-info "Coming soon!"

    In the near term, we plan to add chain abstraction functionality in the Arcana embedded wallet available through the Auth SDK as well. Newer chains, tokens, apps support is in the works. Stay tuned...
