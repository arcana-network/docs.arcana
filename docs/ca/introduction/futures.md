# Futures

## {{config.extra.arcana.ca_sdk_name}}

Today, developers can enable [[concept-unified-balance|unified balance]] in any dApp by integrating it with the [[concept-casdk| {{config.extra.arcana.ca_sdk_name}}]]. It supports unified balance across the following chains and tokens. We are actively working on adding support to enable unified balance across newer chains and tokens.

## {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} CA Wallet (Standalone)

Besides the SDK, we have also [[ca-demo|demonstrated]] our **Chain Abstraction** technology through a standalone {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Wallet implementation ([download here]({{config.extra.arcana.ca_wallet_download_url}})). It allows [[concept-unified-balance|unified balance]] across the following chains and tokens. Only a few Web3 apps are supported at present. We are working on adding support for more apps in the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} CA wallet. Stay tuned.
