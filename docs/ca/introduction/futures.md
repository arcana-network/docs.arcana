# Futures

## {{config.extra.arcana.ca_sdk_name}}

Developers can enable [[ca-top#unified-balance|unified balance]] in any dApp by integrating it with the [[concept-casdk| {{config.extra.arcana.ca_sdk_name}}]].

Unified balance is supported across the following chains and tokens. We are actively working on adding support to enable unified balance across newer chains and tokens.

### Chains
      
{% include "./text-snippets/ca_supported_chains.md" %}

### Tokens

{% include "./text-snippets/ca_supported_tokens.md" %}

## {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} CA Wallet (Standalone)

Besides the SDK, we offer a standalone {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Wallet with **Chain Abstraction** ([download here]({{config.extra.arcana.ca_wallet_download_url}}). This wallet supports [[ca-top#unified-balance|unified balance]] across many chains and tokens. Refer to the supported chains and tokens list below.

Currently, it works with a limited set of Web3 apps. We are actively working to expand app support in our CA wallet.
