{{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} allows Web3 apps to onboard users seamlessly through supported authentication providers. Authenticated users instantly access the embedded Arcana wallet, enabling them to sign blockchain transactions. Developers can programmatically perform Web3 wallet operations, such as token transfers and checking balances, and standard Ethereum JSON-RPC calls for blockchain transactions, in the user's context.

!!! tip

      If you're experienced with Web3, including user onboarding, passwordless login, and Web3 wallet operations, feel free to skip the beginner's section and dive into the [[new-to-web3#step-1-understanding-arcana-auth|'Understanding {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}}']] section below.

## Step 1: Understanding {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}}

Now that you are familiar with the basics, let us take a look at what {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} is and what it can do for Web3 app developers.

* [[what-is-arcana-auth|What is {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}}?]]

* [[why-arcana-auth|Why should you use {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}?]]

* [[how-to-use-auth|How to use the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} in Web3 apps?]]

* [[use-cases|Auth Use Cases]]

## Step 2: Getting Started with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}

**Register App**: To use the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} in your application, you need to first [[configure-auth|register the application]] using the [{{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/dashboard.md). Configure [[index-config-social-providers|social providers]] to onboard users before you [[index-integrate-app|integrate your application]] and call any {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} functions in your application.

**Install & Integrate App**: After configuring application settings using the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}, you can install the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} and integrate your application. Once integrated, applications can access the `AuthProvider` interface to onboard users and enable authenticated users to sign blockchain transactions.

**Onboard Users**: There are two ways to add user onboarding functionality in an app using the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} by using built-in plug-and-play login UI or building a user login UI from scratch and adding code for enabling various supported authentication providers. For the new Web3 developers, we recommend the [[concept-plug-and-play-auth|{{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} plug-and-play feature]] that is quick and easy to use. Seasoned developers can build custom user authentication UI. See [[index-onboard-users|User Onboarding Guide]]. 

**Wallet Ops**: Developers can choose to enable the built-in {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI or plug in a custom wallet UI when integrating an app with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. Once authenticated, an embedded, non-custodial wallet is instantly available to users for signing blockchain transactions. See the [[index-arcana-wallet|{{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} Developer's Guide]] for details. To learn about how the app users access the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI to perform Web3 operations and sign blockchain transactions, see the [[index-wallet-user-guide|{{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} User Guide]].

**Deploy App**: First deploy the integrated app on the Testnet and then migrate to the Mainnet. See [[deploy-app|Deployment Guide]] on how to deploy an app. Learn [[migrate-app-testnet-mainnet|how to migrate an app deployed on the Testnet to the Mainnet]].

*Now that you understand the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} usage better let's get into some sample applications and coding!*

## Step 3: Example Code

=== "Auth Example"

    This is a vanilla HTML/JS application that integrates with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}, allows users to onboard via configured authentication providers and enables the authenticated users to sign blockchain transactions via the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}.
