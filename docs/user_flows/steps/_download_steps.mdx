1. Generate a temporary public/private key pair **T**, where

     T = {public key $P_k$, private key $S_k$} associated with an address **A**

2. Initiate a meta-transaction to the Gateway node. This will record the download request on Arcana blockchain and the address **A**. Note that this address **A** corresponds to the temporary public/private key pair *T*, created earlier.

3. Get the transaction hash from the Gateway node.

4. Sign the transaction using the temporary private key, $S_k$ and send it to the DKG node.

5. DKG node verifies the signature.

6. DKG node verifies on chain that address **A** has the requisite permission to download the file.

7. DKG node encrypts the key shares using the temporary public key $P_k$ and sends it to the client.

8. Client uses the temporary private key, $S_k$, to decrypt the key shares.

9. Client reconstructs the symmetric key **S** from the key shares.
