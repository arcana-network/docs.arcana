### What role do validators play in the Arcana Network?

Validator nodes refer to partner infrastructure that participates in the distributed key generation protocol (DKG). This is used to assign unique keys to authenticated users and manage them in a decentralized manner.

Validators play a key role in achieving the decentralization goal thereby making Arcana Network more secure and truly open.

### Where do I get the DKG binaries from?

Refer to the DKG repository at GitHub.

### What is starting ceremony?

It is mandatory for all nodes in the Arcana DKG subsystem to start at the same time for the protocol to function correctly.  This is referred to as the starting ceremony aimed at synchronizing the start of DKG nodes.
