#  Web3 Auth Use Cases

The Arcana Auth SDK allows developers to supercharge their Web3 apps with plug and play user authentication. Also, authenticated app users can use the embedded, non-custodial Arcana wallet and easily, securely sign blockchain transactions without having to install any browser extension or manage keys.

Web3 developers can integrate apps with the Arcana Auth SDK to address the following use cases:

* User authentication
* Enable authenticated users to sign blockchain transactions easily
* Monitor app usage

## User Authentication

* **Plug-and-Play Auth**: Onboard users with a single line of code via `connect` method and enable popular Web2 social providers or passwordless login.

* **Build-your-own-Auth-UI**: Create your own login UX and simply use `loginWithSocial` and `loginWithLink` methods to enable popular Web2 social providers or passwordless login to onboard users.

* **Customize Onboarding**: Choose which providers / login options are visible to the user at the time of logging in to the Web3 application.

## Sign Blockchain Transactions

* **Easily Accessible & Secure Wallet**: Enable *authenticated app users* to sign blockchain transactions without having to learn the Web3 nuances or expose them to tedious key management hoops. At the same time, provide a secure wallet that is fast to plug in and easy to use.

* **Customize Wallet Usage Experience**: Control Arcana wallet visibility by choosing whether it should be always visible in the context of a Web3 application or whether it shows up only when a blockchain transaction is triggered.

* **Wallet Branding**: Allows Web3 application developers to customize the Arcana wallet theme.

* **No Browser Extension Deployment**: Auth SDK allows easy and very simple wallet onboarding for users with no need for installing any browser extension or generating keys.

* **Web3 Wallet Operations**: Enable typical wallet functions in the application for authenticated users:
    - Sign blockchain transactions
    - Send Transaction
    - Send/Receive native, custom tokens
    - Send/Receive NFTs
    - Browse NFTs, view NFT details
    - Add EVM-compatible networks
    - Switch networks
    - Monitor transaction activity
    - JSON-RPC method support
    - Buy crypto via fiat/on-ramp providers

## Monitor App Usage

* **Easily Register Apps**: Developers can easily register and configure the Auth SDK usage and wallet user experience by using the Arcana Developer Dashboard as per their app requirements.

* **Monitor App Usage**: Developers can easily manage and monitor application usage in terms of 'Monthly Active Users' (MAU). They can also configure how apps are deployed on the Arcana Testnet and Mainnet. Billing is done only for the Arcana Mainnet usage. Usage across all apps deployed on Mainnet can be tracked by the developers.

## Upcoming Features

* Gasless transactions
* Multi-factor authentication
