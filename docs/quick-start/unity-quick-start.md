# Quick Start: Unity Gaming Apps

{% include "./text-snippets/warn_early_preview_rel.md" %}

This guide shows how to integrate Unity based Web3 apps with the [[concept-authsdk| {{config.extra.arcana.gaming_sdk_name}}]] to:

* Onboard users easily via one or more [authentication mechanisms]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/authtype/arcanaauth.md#supported-authentication-mechanisms) configured using the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}.
* Enable {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} and allow authenticated users to sign blockchain transactions, manage crypto assets, and [more]({{page.meta.arcana.root_rel_path}}/concepts/anwallet/index.md).

## Overview

Unity app developers can use the {{config.extra.arcana.gaming_sdk_name}} for onboarding users and allowing them to sign blockchain transactions. Follow these general steps:

**Register & Configure**

* Use the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} to register the app; obtain a unique **{{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}**.
* Configure social providers for onboarding app users and other {{config.extra.arcana.gaming_sdk_name}} usage settings via the dashboard.

**Integrate Unity App**

* Set up the {{config.extra.arcana.gaming_sdk_name}}, other dependencies and then integrate the app and call appropriate functions to onboard users.
* Add code in the app for programmatically enabling authenticated users to access Web3 wallet operations supported by the built-in {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI or add a custom wallet UI.

The latest {{config.extra.arcana.gaming_sdk_name}} version is: {{config.extra.arcana.latest_auth_unity_sdk_version}}. 

## Register & Configure

First, follow the instructions to [[configure-auth|register and configure]] the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} usage via the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}. As part of the app registration, a unique value, **{{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}**, is assigned to each app. This is required later for integrating the app with the {{config.extra.arcana.gaming_sdk_name}}.

During app configuration, developers can enable one or more options to onboard app users. For details, see [[index-configure-auth|how to configure {{config.extra.arcana.product_name}} usage]].

## Integrate Unity App

Follow these steps to integrate the Unity app with the {{config.extra.arcana.gaming_sdk_name}}:

### Step 1: Set up Project Assets

- **Arcana Auth Gaming SDK Code Folder:** In the Unity project, copy the code from the [Arcana Auth Gaming SDK repo](https://github.com/arcana-network/auth-unity/tree/main/Assets/ArcanaSDK) and copy them at the location `/Assets/ArcanaSDK`.
- **Dependency Library:** Copy the library dependencies. The `/Assets/Libs/Newtonsoft.Json.dll` library handles JSON processing. It's under the MIT license and free for commercial use.
- **Vuplex WebView:** Purchase Vuplex WebView separately from [https://developer.vuplex.com/webview/overview](https://developer.vuplex.com/webview/overview) and incorporate it into your project at the `/Assets/Vuplex` path.

### Step 2: Configure `ArcanaSDK` object

- Add the `/Assets/ArcanaSDK/Prefab/ArcanaSDK` prefab to your scene.
- Set up the required parameters ({{config.extra.arcana.app_address}} and environment) in the `ArcanaSDK` object in the inspector.

### Step 3: Use Arcana Auth APIs

- First, call `LoginWithSocial` to onboard the user. Choose one of the [[state-of-the-arcana-auth#user-onboarding-options|supported user onboarding options]] such as Google, Steam, etc. 
- Next, call `Request` or `RequestAsync` to make Web3 Wallet operation requests. These methods are similar; choose the one that suits your needs best.

After integrating the Unity app with the {{config.extra.arcana.gaming_sdk_name}} and adding the required code to onboard users via the configured social logins, you are ready to deploy the gaming app.  Depending upon the environment selected during the Auth SDK initialization earlier, the app will be deployed on the Arcana Testnet or Mainnet.

## Deploy App

An app integrated with the {{config.extra.arcana.gaming_sdk_name}} can be deployed for use only **after** the developer has completed these steps:

* Register and configure the app via the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} 
* Integrate the app with the {{config.extra.arcana.gaming_sdk_name}} 
* Add code to onboard users
* Add code to allow authenticated users to sign the blockchain transactions

Developers can choose to deploy one instance of the app (say, under active development) on the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet while simultaneously deploying a stable version of their app (say, one validated on Testnet and ready for users) on the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet. For details on how to deploy your app on the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet / Mainnet, see [[deploy-app|App Deployment Guide]].

!!! caution "Testnet/Mainnet Configuration Settings"

      By default, when an app is registered, a 'Testnet' configuration profile is associated with the app, and a unique **{{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}** is assigned to this 'Testnet' profile. To deploy your app on the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Mainnet, you need to create a corresponding 'Mainnet' configuration profile and update the {{config.extra.arcana.gaming_sdk_name}} integration code to use the **new {{config.extra.arcana.app_address}}** assigned to the app's 'Mainnet' configuration profile. For details on how to deploy your app on the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} Testnet / Mainnet, see [[deploy-app|App Deployment Guide]]. 

!!! tip "Testnet > Mainnet"

      If you have deployed your Unity app on Arcana Testnet and are looking to migrate it on the Mainnet, see [[migrate-app-testnet-mainnet|Testnet > Mainnet Migration Guide]].

That is all!

The Unity app is now ready to onboard users via 'Google'. Once the user logs in, the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} will be instantly accessible for Web3 wallet operations through the UI. Developers can also add code in the Unity app and call wallet functions programmatically via `Request` or `RequestAsync` methods. When a blockchain transaction is triggered programmatically from the app or via user action, a transaction notification is displayed in the Unity app context along with the transaction details. The user can review the transaction details and choose to accept or reject it.
