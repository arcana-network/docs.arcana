# Coming Soon! (Textual Content)

## Gasless Transactions

Soon, Web3 app users will no longer require cryptocurrency to get started! 

Arcana Auth will enable a Web2-like user experience for Web3 app users with the 'gasless' feature. Gasless transaction is a model whereby app users don't have to pay transaction fees. App developers or other revenue models will take care of the transaction fees on behalf of the user.  The user may pay the developer or app provider via fiat or credit card for app usage without bothering about the blockchain transaction intricacies. At the same time, users will have a choice to approve or reject such a 'gasless' transaction conducted on their behalf by other entities. Users continue to exercise full control of their wallet access.
