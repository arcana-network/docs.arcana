     The Radix Public Network is a Layer-1 Decentralized-Finance (DeFi) platform.

     Apps using [Radix](https://www.radixdlt.com//) will soon be able to enable social login by integrating with the  {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} and allow authenticated users to sign blockchain transactions using the embedded, non-custodial {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}.

     ---
  
     *Support for newer blockchain networks!* 
     
     Users of {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} can quickly make transactions using the Near chain once this feature is available. Developers can select this chain as the active chain while registering, configuring and integrating the app with {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. Once the users log into such an app, they can instantly access the wallet with the Near chain displayed as the active chain.
