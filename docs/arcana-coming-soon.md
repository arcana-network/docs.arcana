     *Increase user conversion in Web3 gaming apps with the Arcana Auth Gaming SDK!*

     
     Soon Web3 gaming apps can onboard users effortlessly through social, custom IAM providers, or passwordless login. Authenticated users can instantly access a fully functional, embedded, non-custodial Web3 wallet within the app context.

-    :material-button-pointer:{.lg .middle } **MFA Enhancements** 

     ---
  
     *Boost security with customizable multi-factor authentication!*

     
     Developers can soon enable/disable MFA for enhanced security. App users can choose to set up MFA through Q/A and PIN. These are used to restore access on a new device when a user switches devices.

     *Support for newer blockchain networks!*

     Apps using [Radix](https://www.radixdlt.com//) will soon be able to enable social login by integrating with the  {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} and allow authenticated users to sign blockchain transactions using the embedded, non-custodial {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}.

-    :simple-hive_blockchain:{.lg .middle } **Wallet Off-Ramp** 

     ---
  
     *Support for off-ramping crypto!* 
     
     
     The {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} users can already use the [[arcana-wallet-user-guide#fiat-on-ramp|on-ramp feature]] and load the wallet using fiat and supported cryptocurrencies. Soon, users will have the off-ramp feature that allows them to exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat.
