     *Boost security with customizable multi-factor authentication!*

     
     Developers can soon enable/disable MFA for enhanced security. App users can choose to set up MFA through Q/A and PIN. These are used to restore access on a new device when a user switches devices.

     MultiversX blockchain uses a state sharding scheme for practical scalability, eliminating energy and computational waste while ensuring distributed fairness through a Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS) consensus.

     Apps using [MultiversX](https://multiversx.com/) will soon be able to enable social login and gasless transactions with {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} SDKs.
