By default, every integrated app can allow its authenticated users to instantly access the built-in, embedded Arcana wallet from within the app context with a familiar, easily recognizable global address or an app-specific one.'

# Manage Keyspace 

In this guide you will learn how to specify the keyspace settings in the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} to manage user experience of having the same familiar, easily recognizable wallet address when users log into any app that is integrated with the Auth SDK.

## Prerequisites

* Make sure you can access the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}: {% include "./text-snippets/db_portal_url.md" %}

* The [[register-app-auth| app must be registered]] using the [[concept-arcana-dashboard| {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}]].

*Managing the displayed list of pre-configured chains for authenticated users in {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} UI within the Web3 app is simple!*

## Step 1: Dashboard Log-in

Log in to the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} and click your registered app entry from the 'Manage Apps' screen. Click **Configure** in the LHS navigation area. Select **Chain Management** to configure the default subset of supported chains.

The chain configuration UI is displayed:

## Step 2: Configure Keyspace

Select the registered app from the *Manage Apps** dashboard screen for which you wish to choose the [[concept-keyspace-type| appropriate keyspace type]]. Double click the app and you will see the app dashboard. Click *Configure* in the LHS navigation menu.

Use the **Keyspace** section to select the **App-specific** (default) or **Global Keys** feature. Global keys are less secure (only as compared to app-specific ones) but allow app users to have the same wallet address across different applications in the {{config.extra.arcana.company_name}} ecosystem.

{% include "./text-snippets/db_keyspace.md" %}

**That's all!** :material-party-popper:

## What's Next?

Besides managing the keyspace for the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} you can also [[configure-wallet-chains|configure the list of pre-defined chains displayed in the wallet]], manage user experience and wallet look and feel via the [[configure-wallet-branding|branding setting]], manage [[configure-wallet-visibility|wallet visibility]], choose a [[concept-custom-wallet-ui|custom wallet UI]] instead of the built-in wallet UI, etc.
