# Solana Setup

This guide explains how to activate Solana, a [[concept-non-evm-chains|non-EVM blockchain]] in a Web3 app and allow users to sign blockchain transactions using the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}.

Use the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} to first configure user onboarding settings, select Solana and tailor the blockchain signing experience for an app and then integrate the app with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. 

## Prerequisites

{% include "./text-snippets/db_prerequisites.md" %}

{% include "./text-snippets/db_login.md" %}

## Register App

To register an app that uses the Solana network, create a new app and select the chain type as **Solana**. Select one of the Solana chains as the default chain.

{% include "./text-snippets/non-evm-warning.md" %}

## Configure App

Refer to the [[dashboard-user-guide|{{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} User's Guide]] for details on how to configure the branding, social authentication providers and other settings. In this section, you will learn how to configure Solana network for the app via the **Chain Management** configuration section.

### Manage Solana chains

In the *Manage Apps* screen select the requisite configuration profile to bring up the app dashboard page. In the LHS click **Configure** and select **Chain Management**.

You will see the available Solana chains that will be displayed when a user logs in and accesses the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}}.

### Default Chain

You can select one of the Solana networks and set it as the default chain. The default chain is shown as the selected chain in the {{config.extra.arcana.wallet_name}} displayed in the app's context.

### Edit Chain

To edit a Solana chain's RPC URL or the blockchain explorer URL, select the chain, click **edit** and update the required fields.

<!--
## Switch Chain Type

If you create an app entry with Solana, you can later switch the chain types to EVM-compatible chains or other supported non-EVM chains. Switching to EVM chains will result in the wallet displaying only the EVM chains once the user logs in.  

Note, at a time, developers can only enable either EVM-compatible chains or the Solana chains. In the future, there may be other chains besides Solana that may show up in the **Chain Type** dropdown list.

!!! warning "Dynamic Switching"

      Switching between EVM and non-EVM chains is allowed only during app development. Once the app is deployed and users log in, if a user logs in and the wallet displays the Solana chain as the default one selected by the app developer, switching chains from the wallet UI may not work. If a user logs out and then re-logs into the app, they will see a different type of chain (EVM, non-EVM) and the keys will be different.

For more details on using the dashboard to delete an app, switch between different applications, change configuration profile, monitor usage, etc., see [[dashboard-user-guide|{{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}} User's Guide]]. 

## Next Steps

After setting up Solana chains using the {{config.extra.arcana.dashboard_name}}, you can begin integrating Solana app with the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}}. See [[solana-quick-start|Solana Quick Start Guide]] for instructions on how to install and integrate the {{config.extra.arcana.sdk_name}} with your app. Once integrated, you can add code to onboard users and initiate Web3 wallet operations using the Solana network. Refer to the sample code [[solana-wallet-ops|here]].
